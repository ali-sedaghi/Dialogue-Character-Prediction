rachel,looks touched joey you neveryou never talked about that before
joey,well hey you know what else i could use theres a scene where drake sneaks into olivias bedroom and she doesnt know hes there  which never happened with us and he knows he shouldnt be there but he just wants to look at her you know in a romantic voice and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your makeup when i would think to myself my god sheis beautiful rachel looks very moved and it hurts so much cuz i knew i could never tell you pauses while looking at her with sentiment but it was worth it just to be there looking at you
monica,yeah i think thats great

ross,yeah maybe i do have my whole career in front of me i mean i can still win a nobel prize although the last two papers ive written were widely discredited
phoebe,youre so much more than just brains youre sweet and kind and funny
ross,and sexy
chandler,wait if were lucky and were really really really quiet we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking
chandler,hey zack

chandler,you wouldnt know if jeanettes planning on keeping her baby would ya
monica,i really wanna have a baby chandler yeah me too look ill just get my old job back
monica,no i want you to have a job that you love not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration
chandler,i quit and you learn what i do
monica,its just i think theres never gonna be a right time to have a baby i mean now youre unemployed and in a little while youll find a new job thatll keep you really busy theres always gonna be a reason not to do this but i think once the baby comes forget about all those reasons
joey,in that case should i make sure its on real good he does so repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it
rachel,thank you they walk away
ross,yeah thats it
ross,oh my god we did it he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly

monica,i really wanna have a baby chandler yeah me too look ill just get my old job back
monica,no i want you to have a job that you love not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration
chandler,i quit and you learn what i do
monica,its just i think theres never gonna be a right time to have a baby i mean now youre unemployed and in a little while youll find a new job thatll keep you really busy theres always gonna be a reason not to do this but i think once the baby comes forget about all those reasons
chandler,i guess its always gonna be scary when we have a baby
monica,its gonna be really scary i mean god when we have a baby theres gonna be so much that were not able to control i mean the apartments gonna be a mess i wont have time to clean it what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer messes up all the ribbons what if theres no room for a ribbon drawer because the babys stuff takes up all the space where will all the ribbons go
chandler,should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind

ross,and thats just the herbivores im not even gonna discuss the carnivores their heads are already too big which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development
chandler,to the one sitting next to him really
ross,but all kidding aside in much the same way that homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus
joey,he said erectus
joey,no he really said it
ross, and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus
joey,erectus
