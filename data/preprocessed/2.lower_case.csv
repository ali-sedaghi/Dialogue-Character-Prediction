chandler,"so, you and rachel tonight, uh?"
joey,yeah. it's actually our first official date
chandler,wow! so tonight may be the night! you're nervous?
joey,"naa, no. this is the part i'm actually good at."
chandler,what must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
joey,(pause) it's ok!
chandler,how can you be so confident?
joey,"well, i... i know exactly what i'm gonna do!"
chandler,really? like you have a routine?
joey,"no, no no no no. see. each woman is different.you have to appreciate their uniqueness."
chandler,really?
joey,"no, i do six things! first, i look deep in her eyes. then, i kiss her. next i take my hand and i softly graze her thigh."
chandler,you mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way)
joey,"no! not like that, no no. no, like this. (he starts lightly grazing chandler's thigh)"
chandler,"oh, i see what you mean, that's quite nice. (they look at each other, both embarassed)"
joey,more foosball?
chandler,...and beer!!
monica,(entering) hey!
monica,(to chandler) hey sweetie! (they kiss)
ross,(looking at monica's legs) wow!
chandler,hey! stop staring at my wife's legs! no no! stop staring at your sister's legs!
ross,"i'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?"
chandler,she went on one of those spray-on tan places.
ross,"eh, you got a spray-on tan?"
monica,chandler gets pedicures!
ross,"(laughing) why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?"
chandler,(to monica) why...why?
ross,"still, i can't believe that's sprayed on... i mean, it looks really good. i wonder if i should get one!"
chandler,"sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off."
ross,"so, do you get colours or just french tips?"
monica,there. here's their card.
ross,"thanks. (he takes the card) hey, i know where this place is! it used to be an x-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he is saying) florist. (he goes away)"
phoebe,hey!
chandler,hey pheebs!
monica,hey phoebe!
phoebe,"oh, you won't believe who moved back to town."
monica,"i know, amanda! ah! she called me too! she's the worst!"
chandler,who's amanda?
monica,"she's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. then she moved to england and she picked up this fake british accent. on the machine this is her message. (she apes amanda using an awful british accent) ""monica, darling! it's amanda calling!"""
chandler,are you trying to do a british accent?
monica,(pause) (to phoebe) chandler gets pedicures!
chandler,"just so i know, how many more of those can i expect?"
phoebe,"you know what amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? (apes amanda in a british accent) ""oh, so sorry to catch you on your mo-bile!"" if-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-bile, don't call me on my mo-bile!"""
monica,"i know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met."
phoebe,"oh, i know! ""oh...i slept with billy joel"". all right, who hasn't?"
monica,"oh, what are we gonna do! i don't wanna see her!!"
phoebe,"ugh, let's just cut her out!"
monica,what?
joey,"okay, ross, i realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. let me explain, okay?"
rachel,we weren't doing anything!
joey,"rach, he just saw us."
rachel,shhh.
joey,"but what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? one kiss."
rachel,"no, come on, that is a lie. we also kissed in barbados."
phoebe,cut her out of our lives! just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
monica,"oh, i guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! (to chandler) have you ever done that?"
chandler,"no, had it done to me though. feels good !"
ross,"well... i like how you look, what are you?"
ross,"two, i think a two."
ross,"spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat."
ross,"well, i have a phd, so... (assistant walk out, not impressed by this statement) (ross takes his bathrobe off and he enters the tanning booth. he stands up in front of the red light and the sprayer starts and sprays his face and torso)"
ross,"one mississipi, two mississipi, three mis...(the sprayer starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) wait! wait! i'm not-i've not finished counting!! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room)"
ross,you sprayed my front twice!
ross,"no, i barely even got to three mississippi."
rachel,"yeah, you started it! i've got to chill."
joey,"look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but.."
rachel,"we feel so terrible about this, ross."
joey,"yeah, but it did happen, so..."
joey,ross?
rachel,ross? (to joey) can we just close the door?
rachel,"ross, say something. anything."
ross,so you two are..?
ross,and have you .. ed?
joey,"no, no, no!"
rachel,"no, no, no!"
ross,"but if i hadn't walked in here, would you..?"
monica,"it's so weird, how did joey end up kissing charlie last night? i thought you'd end up kissing charlie."
ross,"hey, i thought i'd end up kissing charlie too ok? but surprise!"
chandler,"i missed most of the party (pause) charlie's a girl, right?"
ross,"yes, she is this new professor of my department that i did not kiss."
rachel,"i don't know why joey had to kiss her! i mean, of all the girls at the party, god!"
ross,"mississippilesly? (pause) well, how bad is it?"
ross,"so, how dark is it gonna get?"
ross,i'm a four?
ross,(sarcastically) really!
ross,(annoyed) ok!
ross,"wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! how do i know when it's gonna start? hello? (he slowly turns and the spraying begins, on his face) ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns again and is sprayed in the front again) ah! (he spits and angrily goes out of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) the same thing happened again!"
ross,(hysterically) i'm an eight!
joey,"i thought you paid. (rachel does not answer and seems puzzled) ha, guess we won’t be going back there!"
monica,"oh, the way you crushed mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.you wanna...? (plays with her finger on chandlers chest)"
chandler,"you know, i'd love to, but i'm a little tired."
monica,i'll put a pillowcase over my head.
chandler,you're on!
joey,probably.
joey,"no, no!"
rachel,"ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. you have every right to go nuts."
ross,i'm not going nuts. do you see me go nuts?
rachel,"no, but you know what i mean."
ross,"hey, hey, hey... if you two are happy, then i'm happy for you. (squeaky.) i'm fine!"
joey,really?
ross,"absolutely. (very squeaky.) i'm fine! totally fine. i don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, (deep voice) i'm fine. i'm not saying i wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. i mean, at first i was like.. (screams.) but now that i've had time to absorb it; lovin' this."
joey,ross..
ross,"it's all working out! me & charlie, and you two. you know what we should do?"
rachel,calm ourselves?
ross,why do you care so much?
monica,"yes rachel, why do you care so much?"
rachel,(worried) be-cause ross is the father of my child! you know... and i... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) i just... all i'm saying is... i don't think that joey and charlie have anything in common.
ross,"oh, i don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils..."
phoebe,"wow, joey and a professor! can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and joey's raw sexual magnetism... oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!"
rachel,"all right, so... ross, you're ok with all this? i mean..."
ross,"yeah, it's no big deal. i mean, i just met her and i'm fine with it..."
ross,"oh, god. i forgot how hot she was!"
joey,hey!
ross,i'm gonna get some more coffee.
ross,ok. (they both go)
rachel,so.
joey,yeah.
joey,"hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?"
rachel,"i say ‘cheesy line’, but ok."
joey,what’s the matter?
rachel,"i am sorry, i don’t know, i am sorry, i don’t know why i did that!"
rachel,"ok, so sorry."
rachel,"i am sorry! again... i don't know, i don’t know what happened, i must be nervous!"
joey,"i don’t get it, chandler loved it!"
rachel,"ok, ok, ok. i promise, i promise, i promise, i won’t do it again. i really do. i promise. this is gonna be great."
joey,"(talking to a pineapple in his hand) god, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?you know you want it to happen as much as i do."
joey,i want you.i need you.let me make love to you.
rachel,"i don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but i think a canelope might hurt less."
joey,"oh, ehm...i'm...i'm rehearsing my lines.they gave me a big romantic story on days of our lives. it's the first time my character's got one. i'm so nervous, you know, i really want it to be good!"
phoebe,hey!
monica,what's up?
phoebe,"well, okay, mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. and then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want..."
ross,... finally...
phoebe,is that ross?
monica,"yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls."
phoebe,sounds like he's with someone.
chandler,"he could be alone. this morning i heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps."
monica,"wait a minute, i think phoebe's right. you know i hear someone else in there with him."
ross,"god, you're amazing... i didn't even have to ask you to call me that."
ross,"no. we should all have dinner. yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. i'll cook!!"
joey,"look, don't you think that will be a little weird?"
ross,"weird? what? what's weird? the only thing weird would be if someone didn't like mexican food, because i'm making fajitas!! (storms off.)"
joey,i do like fajitas.
monica,"god, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. there's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. there are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives."
chandler,there's a hair in my coffee.
phoebe,hey guys!
monica,hey.
phoebe,"hey, have you seen frank jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets."
chandler,"you know, it's funny. every time you say ""triplets,"" i immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds."
monica,that's sweet. drink your hair.
rachel,"(speaking to herself and reading cosmopolitan) oh, lucky me! coffee and a live sex show!"
rachel,"oh... oh, i'm sorry! i'm not... i was just-i was just reading to emma."
rachel,"yeah, yeah... it's... ""climax your way to better skin""."
joey,"so you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good."
chandler,"(to joey) so, a professor, uh?"
joey,"yeah! she is cool, and she's so smart! her mind is totally acrimonious (which, being joey, he mispronounces ""amonious""). (pause) that's not how she used it...?"
ross,"uhm no! think less of you! no, i don't think less of you. i mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. i mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, i hate those people."
ross,"yeah, i know the type."
joey,"hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. no? am i getting close?"
phoebe,(entering) hey!
monica,hey!
phoebe,hey you guys! look what i just got. (she shows them a pair of slippers)
rachel,"oh, oh! wow, i love those! where did you get them?"
joey,ok.
joey,"(a little giddy) uh, was that good for you?"
phoebe,"oh, yeah. could be rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again."
monica,it could be amanda!
phoebe,"oh, you’re right! i was just kidding about rachel. babysitting is a gas!"
monica,you're from yonkers! your last name is buffo-martisis!
phoebe,"ok, don’t hold thy breath!"
chandler,hello? is someone on the line?
chandler,"hang on, she’s right here. (he enters the living room and hands the phone to monica) someone's on the phone, for ya."
monica,"we weren’t picking up, it’s amanda!"
rachel,woow!i haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
joey,"yeah, that was a disappointment...(pause) oh, hey!d'you want to come down to the set and tell me if i'm doing ok?"
rachel,(excited) are you serious?
joey,"yeah!hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again."
rachel,"hey, that was an honest mistake!"
joey,"right!(he starts to ape her)""oh my god, is this the men's room? oh, i feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?"" (he inclines his head as if to look at a man's private parts)"
rachel,"yeah, that was an awesome day!"
monica,hey!
phoebe,hey!
ross,hi!
monica,"oh my god, that's charlie!"
chandler,she's cheating on joey with ross!
phoebe,oh that tart... floozy... giant...
monica,i'm not sure about this.
phoebe,"yeah, you're right. this is none of our business."
monica,no i'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. someone get me a glass!
phoebe,"oh, i'm not gonna do this, okay? i'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend."
rachel,(through wall) ooh... i love barbados!
joey,ooh... i can't believe i'm kissing you. i'm kissing rachel!
rachel,"i know, i'm her!"
phoebe,(whispering) rachel and joey! it's rachel and joey!!!
phoebe,"hey, what's all this stuff?"
monica,"oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies."
phoebe,"ooh, babies! oh, this one is so cute, get this one!"
monica,that's not really how it works.
phoebe,"oh, how does it work?"
monica,i don't know!
phoebe,"well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, bill and colleen. they adopted a kid. i'm sure they'd help you."
monica,"thanks, that would be great. hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?"
phoebe,hey!
phoebe,good to see you.
monica,hi frank.
monica,"oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!"
joey,"(enters the room) hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?"
chandler,"(browsing through a diary) well, let me see... i-i believe i'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the tv."
joey,"look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play."
chandler,i could fall asleep at a play.
phoebe,what is it?
rachel,"(hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!"
joey,oh hey rach!
rachel,yeah...
joey,maybe you could take charlie shopping.
rachel,"oh, well..."
joey,"are you kidding? rachel loves to shop! and she has great taste! yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes."
rachel,"ok, uh-uh... let's-let's shop!!"
joey,"(to charlie) ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, slutty!"
phoebe,"(entering and talking on mobile phone) ok, great! all right, bye! (she hangs up) pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) that's off, right?"
joey,"what's the matter, pheebs?"
phoebe,"oh... mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. and she was like ""oh, don't worry! i asked him. he's totally ok with seeing you!"". so now i have to go so he'll think that i'm totally ok with seeing him!"
rachel,"which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!"
phoebe,exactly!
phoebe,i bought them off ebay! they used to belong to the late shania twain.
rachel,"(after a pause) phoebe, shania twain is still alive!"
phoebe,oh... then i overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)
monica,"hey, what's this?"
rachel,"oh, it's a gift certificate to this new spa in soho."
monica,"oh, you can't show phoebe this! she hates those corporate massage chains."
rachel,"ah, why, now i can't get a massage? there are so many things that she disapproves of! i can't eat veal, i can't wear fur, i can't go hunting..."
monica,do you wanna go hunting?
rachel,"well, i would like to have the option!!"
phoebe,"(coming back from the bathroom) what's up? (she sees the gift certificate in rachel's hands) hey, rachel!!"
rachel,oh!
phoebe,"no, you can't go there! you know how i feel about these ""big massage places""! they're putting people like me out of business!"
monica,"and she wants to go hunting, too!!"
rachel,"phoebe, come on, i don't wanna waste it! it would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!"
chandler,(to amanda) i get pedicures!
monica,"hi amanda! actually now... it’s... is not a good time. dinner tomorrow night? (phoebe mouths 'no') ok, phoebe and i will see you then!"
phoebe,"why, why, why didn’t you just say no!"
monica,"well, i said 'no' to her coming over now! i couldn’t say 'no' twice! i get this uncontrollable need to please people!"
phoebe,"(leaving) fine, fine! you would not hold up well under torture!"
monica,and you would?
phoebe,i did!
rachel,"absolutely! absolutely. i d... it’s just a little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some getting used to."
joey,"ok. well, how, how can we make it easier?"
rachel,"ok, let’s work from the top down! (joey nods, but then puzzled because he does not get it) just work the bra, joe!"
joey,"ok, yeah, got it."
joey,this thing welded shut?!
joey,"monica, hey, can i borrow the porsche?"
monica,ok.
joey,alright!
monica,but ehm...what is it not?
joey,(abashed) a place to entertain my lady friends.
monica,and what else is it not?
joey,(even more abashed) a place to eat spaghetti.
monica,"so, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?"
phoebe,sure!
ross,i'd love to!
monica,well you can't! we're booked solid for the next month!
phoebe,"well, i can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!"
ross,"phoebe, what happened?"
phoebe,"well, it was an accident...you know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!"
chandler,(to monica) have i got a surprise for you? pack your bags!
phoebe,oh no!you guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
chandler,"what? no, i'm taking monica to a romantic inn in vermont (shows them a brochure)!"
phoebe,"oh, good!ok, good for you!try to recapture the magic!"
chandler,"so, what do you say? can you get out of work?"
monica,what?
phoebe,get over here!
rachel,ooh...
chandler,wow!
monica,"(in her monica-excited-way... too loud!) oh my god, i love how thin these walls are!"
monica,(muffled) thank you.
rachel,"hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? what changed?"
joey,"well, i only said that because of ross, you know. then i saw him kissing charlie..."
rachel,"what? ross and charlie? (joey nods) wow! she's really making her way through the group, huh? ah, who am i to talk?"
monica,i can't believe this. rachel and joey?
monica,which one is which again?
joey,"ah, can i just say i know we're doing this for ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date."
rachel,"well, what would we be doing?"
joey,"i'd take you out for a romantic night. some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home..."
rachel,feel me up?
joey,in a carriage!
joey,"hey, charlie!"
rachel,hey.
rachel,"oh, you bet."
joey,"so, did you bring a little something for ross?"
joey,"oh. oh, thanks."
joey,"it's a one-woman play called ""why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life""."
monica,it sounds interesting!
ross,"yeah, it does sound interesting, i mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, i don't think it gets bett... (ross starts snoring, faking to fall asleep)"
phoebe,"i know, i know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?"
joey,"you guys are gonna have a great time, i promise!"
ross,what? how come that you don't have to go!
joey,"i wish i could but i just found out that i have to be at work really early the next day, so i can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want."
chandler,"(browsing through a diary) uh, let's see, who do i hate?"
rachel,"(gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but joey blocks her way) oh, sorry... oops, sorry."
joey,"(lifts rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) hey, here you go."
rachel,"ooh... oooh... (pause) (rachel is all bah-jiggity about joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to monica) can i ask you a question?"
monica,yeah.
rachel,and you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
phoebe,"(after a short pause) i didn't even think about that! (pause) aaargh, sexual politics!!"
rachel,"hey pheebs, i'm-i'm taking charlie shopping, why don't you come and i'll help you find something."
phoebe,"ok, that'll be great!"
joey,"oh, ain't that nice? the three of you trying on slutty lingerie together."
rachel,that's not what we're gonna do!
joey,"why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?"
chandler,(looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) wow! fortunately she has a very pretty face!
monica,"oh, i so can't believe this! my uterus is an inhospitable environment? i was trying so hard to be a good hostess!"
chandler,"oh, i can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!"
chandler,hi.
phoebe,"ok, this is not about the money, ok? it's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells."
rachel,i don't care about any of that!!
phoebe,"well, do you care about friendship?"
rachel,oh!
phoebe,"i feel really strongly about this, rachel. please, don't use this gift certificate. i'm asking you as a friend."
rachel,"oh, not as a friend, phoebe!! fine, i won't use it!"
phoebe,promise?
rachel,i promise.
phoebe,thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)
rachel,but i am going hunting!!
monica,(entering) hey honey! i missed you today!
chandler,"oh, yeah?"
rachel,okay.
joey,"all right, turn around, i got to get a look at this thing."
rachel,oh!
rachel,ow!
joey,sorry!
rachel,well this is romantic!
joey,"i'm sorry! (he stands up) this never happened to me before! i'm an expert at taking off bras! i can do it with one hand! i can do it with my eyes closed! one time i just looked at one, and it popped open! i blame your bra!"
rachel,it’s a standard issue bra clasp!
joey,then i blame you! yeah! that's right! you threw me off with all your slapping!
rachel,"ok well, well i'm really, i'm sorry about that joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?"
joey,(contemplates for a few moments what rachel just said) nah! i don't have another level!!
chandler,hold on! there is something different.
monica,very good! (gives him the keys) what do you need it for anyway?
joey,"oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in new york, so..."
rachel,oh! so you're driving up to connecticut?
joey,(hesitates for a moment)yeah connecticut...not west virginia.
monica,"hey, maybe i'll drive you up there! i'd like to buy some tickets myself!"
joey,uh!
monica,"yeah with chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars."
chandler,"yeah, because if i was at my old job we'd say 300 million? no thank you!"
phoebe,hey will you get me tickets too?
rachel,"yeah me too. oh! i have an idea. why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!"
monica,"oh, honey!i can't. i was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!"
chandler,are you really that busy?
monica,"yeah, i'm sorry. i really am."
chandler,"oh, that's ok.i'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) ""hi, this is chandler bing. i made a reservation there and i need to change it (pause) oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? can i just come some other time? (pause) oh, can't you make an exception?"""
monica,tell them i'm a chef in a big new york restaurant!
phoebe,and tell them that in 2 weeks i will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
chandler,"(on the phone) ""look, this is ridiculous! i'm not paying for that room! ok?"" (pause) ""oh, thank you very much!"" (hangs up) yeah, i'm going to vermont..."
ross,"oh, don't worry about it! just use your travel insurance."
chandler,i don't have travel insurance.
ross,"well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!"
monica,why don't you take ross?
chandler,hey! ready to go?
ross,"oh yeah, let me just finish this."
joey,"hey ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, i can't do that!"
chandler,what are you doin'?
ross,"have you seen this? it's a new alumni website for college! it's cool! you can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to."
chandler,"great, a faster way to tell people that i'm unemployed and childless ."
chandler,how about the dinosaur twins in the other room? no-one is manning that wall!
monica,i'm on it!
chandler,anything?
monica,i think i hear curtains closing...
phoebe,we've got shoes being kicked off over here.
monica,"bedsprings, unmistakable!"
chandler,you do realise that's your brother?
monica,"not until you said it. somebody switch! (chandler makes a clicking sound with his fingers and phoebe runs to the other wall. monica returns to chandlers wall.) wait a minute... ross and charlie, joey and rachel, phoebe and mike! we're the only people leaving with the same person we came with."
chandler,that's not true. i came with monica and i'm leaving with weird al.
monica,"okay, i've had it with the hair jokes. tomorrow morning, before we leave, i'm going to the salon."
chandler,okay buckwheat!
chandler,did you see our bank statement? could this be right?
monica,i know...god. i haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed oreos. what happened to all our money?
chandler,i'm not sure what they did...but i'm inclined to blame ***
monica,"i guess with you doing the internship, we're spending more than we're bringing in."
joey,"yeah, i didn't throw any of that out.."
ross,"i thought i heard voices! hi charlie! (kisses her.) hi joey. (hugs him.) and.. oh! you're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. (laughs.) i'm just kidding, i know rachel, i know. (he squeezes her hand.) come, please come in. come in."
rachel,"okay, well, we brought you some wine."
ross,oh! that is so thoughtful. (to joey.) she's a keeper. and what did you bring me? (grabs the bag that charlie brought for joey.)
joey,"uh, actually, that's.."
ross,"underwear, a toothbrush, and van halen cd. i can use all these things!!"
ross,what? fine? because i am! aren't you? aren't you? aren't you? you see? who else is fine?
joey,"okay, listen, hey, ross. why don't you try to relax, okay? maybe have a drink."
ross,you know what? that is a very good idea. i'm gonna go make a pitcher of margaritas.
phoebe,"oh, god. so adorable. look at them sleeping there like angels."
rachel,do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
monica,"no, i don't think it ever works. why?"
rachel,no reason.
monica,"no, no, rachel?"
rachel,yeah
monica,who do you wanna fool around with?
rachel,"(with high pitched voice) nobody, forget it!"
rachel,(giggling and whispering) maybe.
monica,(whispering) you can't!
rachel,"(whispering) why? (monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with ""because"") seriously i did not understand a word that you said."
monica,in the hall.
monica,hi.
monica,ok.
chandler,"oh, damn it!"
monica,"don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out."
monica,(long pause) ok.
chandler,"is that a hint? because we love you doctor connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (dr. connelly glares at him) wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!"
rachel,"hi! ok, you're ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping?"
joey,"(to charlie) alright, have a good time. (they kiss)"
rachel,not gonna find any clothes in there!
ross,"(entering) hey, you guys!"
rachel,hi.
ross,guess who's up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference?
monica,yeah. (they kiss) what d'you wanna do tonight?
chandler,"oh, well... maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites monica to have sex on it)"
monica,"ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? know your audience! besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank."
chandler,we really need to take those tests?
monica,"honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. i think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. just a few routine tests."
chandler,but i don't wanna do it in a cup!
monica,what is the big deal?
chandler,it's weird! in a doctor's office?
monica,it's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a taco bell?
chandler,"(embarrassed) i cannot believe ross told you that! (pause) and in my defense, it was a wendy's!"
monica,"look, i don't wanna do this test either, but i really do think it's a good idea!"
ross,i went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
chandler,was that place... the sun?
ross,"oh! and it gets worse! (turns his side to chandler and monica and pulls up his shirt. there's a distinct line across his body, where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)"
chandler,oh my god! you can do a duet of ebony and ivory all by yourself!
monica,"how could you mess this up? it's so easy? you go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!"
ross,(looks at her suspiciously) how do you count to five?
monica,one two three...
ross,"(yells) damnit! (goes to the door to leave. rachel just enters, sees him and starts laughing)"
rachel,(laughing) oooh! oh oh!
ross,(still yelling) i know!
rachel,oh oh! what is up with miss hawaiian tropic?
chandler,how was your date with joey?
chandler,hey!
joey,hey!
joey,where’s monica?
chandler,oh she’s at home putting up decoration for rachel’s birthday party tonight.
joey,and you are not helping?
chandler,"i try, but…apparently singing “i will survive” in a helium voice, not helping."
chandler,hey!
ross,yeah! yeah! ok! sure! look! can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
chandler,sure! just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! do you believe that who ever
ross,ok you...you really don't know what i am talking about?
ross,no thanks!
phoebe,you don't wanna win the lottery?
ross,"(in a mocking voice)uh...sure i do, and i also wanna be king of my own country and find out what happened to amelia earhart."
chandler,still on amelia earhart?
ross,the woman just vanished!
joey,"seriously, ross, you don't want in on this?"
ross,no! do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? i...i mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
chandler,yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
joey,i like those odds!
ross,"seriously you guys, i can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, i mean that's such a bunch of boohaki."
chandler,(looking around at the others)i'll ask. (to ross) boohaki?
ross,"oh oh, we think emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her."
ross,"uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? i mean, two guys in a romantic inn..."
monica,"no, not if their room has two beds!"
ross,(browsing the brochure) i guess...it still seems a little...(enthusiastically) moonlight boat ride!!
rachel,"hey joey, is this the bed where olivia lost her virginity?"
joey,"i don't know, but one of the extras sure did! (pause) hey, listen rach. thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!"
rachel,"oh, please!honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, i'm...oh my god!is that christian sanders?he's so gorgeous!"
joey,also so gay!
rachel,"oh, in my head he's done some pretty ""not-gay-stuff""!"
joey,"well, at the christmas party him and santa did some definitely gay stuff!"
joey,"oh, wish me luck!"
rachel,"ok, not that you need it but good...god!is that chase lassiter?he's straight, right?"
ross,it's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember andrea rich?
chandler,the tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
ross,"uh uh... well, her internet company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident..."
chandler,bet she'd sleep with you now...
ross,no... i already e-mailed her.
chandler,"let me see what you wrote about yourself: ""doctor paleontology, two kids... "" (pause) you split with carol because you have different interests?... i think you split with carol because you've one very similar interest!"
ross,"you know what? i'm gonna finish this later, ok? let me just grab my coat."
joey,hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again)
ross,(he picks up the ball) what do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)
chandler,"maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on ross' computer) ""also i cloned a dinosaur in my lab. she's now my girlfriend. i don't care what society says. it's the best sex i've ever had""... aaand send!"
joey,"(he stops chandler from posting the message) no, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!"
ross,"(he comes back) alright, let's go!"
joey,dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from ross' hands)
phoebe,"you gotta hear this, it's great... it's like free porn! (chandler eagerly rushes over)"
ross,weh...*sigh*
ross,"yeah, it's just... i don't think i can do this..."
ross,"no, no! (they're moving to the side of the bed, where they sit down) look, i need to talk to joey. i mean, you guys just broke up. before anything more happens between us, i need to know he's okay with it."
ross,"alright, i'm gonna go find them... (twitches a bit, looks down) i just need a... need a before i can... you know. (gestures standing up... they sit and wait for a while) grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries to concentrate...) okay, i see you later."
phoebe,that's the door. he's gone...
chandler,and she's... turning on the tv... and watching... miss congeniality!
monica,"honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!"
ross,"hey, what are you guys doing?"
phoebe,"oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) i love you... paradise hotel, golf resort and spa... (she walks away from the wall)"
monica,"(also hugs the wall) yeah, we had a great time, thank you! (walks to phoebe)"
chandler,maybe i should quit and get a job that pays.
monica,oh...but you're finally doing something that you love! i can't ask you to give that up. though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was..y'know..finding gold
chandler,you know what? you know what? i think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? so we pay our bills a little late this month. and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. and maybe we start eating out of joey's refridgerator for a change. you're chef..what can you make out of bacon soda and beer?
monica,ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
chandler,no! we're not borrowing money.
monica,why not?
chandler,because we don't do that. we are bings! and if there's one thing my father taught me was...well to always knock before going into the poolhouse...but the other thing was...never borrow money.
phoebe,"well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute."
phoebe,"oh, god, the last time i babysat them, they did the funniest thing.."
phoebe,"that's a, that's a long time."
phoebe,"yeah, i know, frank. i counted them when they were coming out of my area."
phoebe,what?
phoebe,"oh my god, frank, are you thinking of leaving? because i didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!"
phoebe,what?! you can't separate them! that's terrible. which one?
monica,you wanna fool around with joey?
rachel,"yeah! you know, ever since i had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! and what's the big deal, people do it all the time!"
monica,who? who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
rachel,"ok, off the top of my head... don and janet."
monica,"who, who are they?"
rachel,i know them from work.
monica,both of them?
rachel,"no, one of them..."
monica,which one?
rachel,"i don't know, what were the names i just said?"
monica,"rachel, things can get incredibly complicated."
ross,"yeah, right! what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and charlie laugh, then joey starts laughing too without any reason) well, why are you laughing?"
joey,"just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!"
ross,"professor sherman, yeah. i've a meeting with him today."
ross,"yeah, well... i think i know how to dazzle him."
rachel,"oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?"
ross,"tsz... no! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve)."
chandler,(entering) hey guys!
ross,"wait a minute, you guys. oh, i wanna ask you something. i-i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do, i'd love for you guys to come and hear me."
chandler,"i think i can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick."
ross,it's in barbados.
chandler,"yeah, ok. i'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the hershey's factory!"
monica,(really embarrassed) oh!
chandler,"oh, yeah! rachel talks too!"
joey,(sipping red wine from a glass) who says that wine has to cost more than milk!
joey,heeey!
joey,"come on in, how are ya?"
joey,can i offer you a drink?
joey,"uh-oh. i hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today i had to open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!"
joey,"hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)"
rachel,"well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and i kept slapping it away!"
chandler,you didn't like that?
rachel,"well, it wasn't just me, alright? he freaked out too! he couldn't even undo my bra!"
monica,"wow, really? one time he just looked at my bra and it popped open."
rachel,"i do not know what's wrong with us, i mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! but this time it was leading somewhere and i was very aware of the fact that it was joey touching me."
monica,"well, you guys have been friends forever. remember the first time that you kissed ross? how weird that was? you couldn't stop laughing? you got through that."
chandler,hey!
monica,"good morning, tiger! i'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. you're gonna get me good and pregnant."
chandler,i've got nowhere to go this morning. i'm unemployed! i don't know what i'm gonna do with my life.
monica,"well, i just lost my erection."
chandler,"i mean, what am i supposed to do with myself?"
monica,you're supposed to find your passion in life. you can be whatever you wanna be now. it's exciting.
joey,(entering) hey! i'm all packed and ready to go!
ross,hey you guys!
joey,hey!
rachel,"shhhh…don’t say that loud, gunther gonna wants to hug me…(chandler and joey nod in agreement)"
ross,"err…good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. (point to molly)this is molly. molly, (point to chandler) chandler, (point to joey) joey."
ross,"(looking at emma) oop, somebody get a little fussy."
joey,you damn right i am. i’ve been waiting for cookies for 7 minutes!
rachel,"ok. you know what, i just gonna take her outside."
rachel,"wow, molly is just great!"
ross,yeah
chandler,"yes, bravo on the hot nanny."
chandler,no!
ross,ok! last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
chandler,our balcony? seriously? that's so funny because i told monica we should put lights on our balcony. and she said
ross,"right that's why i came over to talk about. hum...i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,"
chandler,so are you gonna...talk to her?
ross,"why...why should i? i mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!"
chandler,"you know when ""that's fine"" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!"
ross,no i'm serious. i mean she wants to date people? fine! i don't care but...at least she could have told me. you know
chandler,no no no. good. so you're moving on? do you have any idea where you're moving?
rachel,"yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker."
monica,how do you know she's gonna start talking?
rachel,well when i talk to her i almost feel like she understands what i'm saying.
chandler,kinda like joey.
joey,(who wasn't paying attention)what's that now?
monica,god! look at all these tickets! it's so exciting! you know i haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
chandler,pie eating contest?
monica,oh! you assume because i was heavy that's the only way i could win something?
chandler,"no, i saw a picture of you covered in blueberries."
joey,"rach, i gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay i don't know if i could do this!"
rachel,"oh, i'm sorry, you're right.i'm sorry, good luck! (they hug)"
rachel,"(watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) oh!"
rachel,ssshhhhttt!!he's asking her a question!!
rachel,"no! (pause) or, cut!you know, that's your call!"
ross,i think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
joey,(after ross leaves the room) aaand send! (he hits the send button)
rachel,hey! how was basketball?
joey,"oh, it was a lot of fun right up until chandler got a finger in the eye!"
rachel,"oh, no! who did that?"
joey,chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near emma's cot) rach... what's hugsy doin' in the crib with emma? (he looks puzzled)
rachel,"she was just crawling around and she found him, so i just let her sleep with him. that's all right? isn't it?"
joey,"(still very puzzled) oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... i know that!"
rachel,"joey... are you sure? i mean, i know how much you love him!"
joey,"rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? i do not love hugsy. i like him a normal amount..."
chandler,(caresses the wall with his finger) bye!
ross,"okay, uhm... hey, you guys seen joey anywhere?"
chandler,he's probably in his room with his current girlfriend charlie. that's the situation as we know it... (walks to phoebe and monica)
ross,"well, if you see him could you please tell him i'm looking for him?"
chandler,you got it!
ross,thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the wall) thank you! (closes the door)
monica,"other wall, people! other wall!"
ross,"(knocks on door) rach, you there? (joey and rachel both get up from the bed)"
joey,"oh my god, it's ross. what are we gonna do?"
chandler,"yeah. that’s a lot of cats, jolene. single, are ya?"
chandler,chandler bing.
joey,[on phone] hey. how come you’re answering your own phone? where’s your crazy assistant?
chandler,"what’s up, joe?"
monica,wow! i had no idea you had this much pride.
chandler,that's right! i do! and i'm your man. and i'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
phoebe,oh...you don't have to go...i have something that will fit you.
phoebe,i want you to stay.
phoebe,why don't you turn them inside o-
phoebe,i'll miss you.
phoebe,great! ok...i'll go get the tube top.
phoebe,"wow..mike hannigan...you sure know how to make a girl say ""hell yeah!"""
phoebe,yeah! let's do it! let's live together! (they embrace and mike kisses phoebe)
monica,thank you so much for seeing us. phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
chandler,"so, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?"
chandler,"i mean, you have a lovely home."
monica,"well, we appreciate anything you can tell us."
monica,oh my god!
monica,thank you. (to chandler.) i think i just had a tiny orgasm.
chandler,that's great. (to monica.) can i see the book?
chandler,"you want me to wash my hands first, don't you?"
monica,it's.. it's just so pretty and white.
monica,can i adopt you?
rachel,"all right, all right, you're right, i won't do anything with joey, i just thought that we (joey enters the hall) ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion? (joey enters his apartment)"
monica,what the hell are you cooking!
ross,hey!
monica,hey!
chandler,hey!
ross,"hey, you guys won't believe what i have to do for work today."
chandler,"yes, but, ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs."
ross,"(covering with his hand chandler's face, like pretending he's not there) (to monica) there're these two professors who are joining my department and i have to meet them here and show them around campus."
monica,what's so bad about that?
ross,it's i just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
monica,(fingering her elbow): ross?
ross,"(looking his elbow, where there's a patch) these aren't suede."
ross,"hi, hi, i'm ross geller."
chandler,but you come first!
rachel,i'm there!
joey,bye.
rachel,"bye, see ya. (she goes)"
chandler,(sitting down on the couch) ok.
joey,"all right, so. how did it go at the fertility clinic?"
chandler,not as much fun as last time. apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
ross,so-so what did the doctor say?
chandler,"well... there's surrogacy, but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her."
joey,so you're ruling out surrogacy?
chandler,yeah.
joey,"so, i don't have to learn what that means?"
chandler,"aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors."
joey,"yeah, definitely, definitely. ok, what do you wanna see first?"
joey,(looking puzzled and nodding) ok!
joey,"i know, yeah!"
joey,"ok, let me stop you right there. the mets suck, ok? you wanna see the yankees."
joey,"which one, they all suck!"
joey,(looking puzzled) i don't think so.
rachel,(to the receptionist) hi there!
rachel,"oh, hi. i have a massage appointment under rachel green, and here is my gift certificate."
rachel,and... taped back together.
rachel,"(looking thoughtful) ok, that's true. that's true, we can do this. you're right, you're right, we can do this. we're just gonna power through!"
joey,hey chandler can i talk to you for a second (points to the hall).
rachel,"(to joey) no need!! problem solved, we are powering through (at which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment)."
monica,"(sees what he is doing) chandler, stop! it is not going to pop open!"
chandler,(without taking his eyes off the bra) you don't know! (monica just smiles)
monica,hey phoebe!
phoebe,hey!
monica,is amanda here yet?
phoebe,no.
monica,"(sits down) oh good. good, look i'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. but i have a new plan. chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency."
phoebe,"oh! well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?"
chandler,but it's all so overwhelming. i don't know where to start.
monica,"hey, wait a second. i can help you with this. you just need to be organized. we can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. there could be folders and files!"
chandler,hey! this is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
monica,i know!!! my erection is back!
joey,(to gunther who comes over with coffee and a muffin) thank you!
phoebe,"joey, can i have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?"
joey,okay.
joey,": pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry italian?"
phoebe,"i'm sorry, it's just, i'm a little short on cash."
joey,if you want i could loan you some money?
ross,"oh, that's right! (to emma) daddy and uncle joey are going on a trip today. we're going to a conference in barbados, right?"
joey,mmh-mmh.
ross,(to emma) can you say barbados?
joey,barbados!
ross,"ok, i gotta say. i mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! uh! and i've a surprise, uh... i had to pull some strings but i was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! that's right! (he gives them their passes) this babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars."
rachel,do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
chandler,"yeah ross, i mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff""."
phoebe,i think david would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
ross,"oh, right, because he's a scientist!"
phoebe,"no, no, because, you know, he's been in minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die."
ross,"ok, we gotta go, yeah? so, we'll see you guys tomorrow."
joey,"all right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally."
rachel,what? you really think she is hot?
chandler,"are you kidding? if i wasn’t married, she would be rejecting me right now."
rachel,joey?
joey,(looking at molly outside)how do you think she’s doing?
rachel,am i the only one that doesn’t think she is hot? ross?
ross,"nehh!...i mean she’s not unattractive but…hot(making his face, as if saying “no”)"
rachel,thank you.
chandler,now that rachel’s gone?
ross,"so hot, i cried myself to sleep last night."
phoebe,"hey mike, what is the capital of peru?"
phoebe,no. hmm...it starts with a v and end with an x. hopefully with a to in the middle.
ross,i don't know. i mean i have plenty of opportunity. just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.
chandler,"dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!"
ross,"well, and how about this? there is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental"
chandler,why did i get married?!
joey,hey! let me ask you guys something. i have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks i
phoebe,well it depends.
joey,on...?
phoebe,on how far along he's in the sex change process!
monica,"no i totally disagree. no i think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. such you an actor. not that you need to,"
joey,ok! stop it you guys! stop staring! you're freaking me out!
monica,(smiling)that was a good day!
ross,"(yelling to monica)they're towing your car, they're towing your car!!"
monica,i'm parked in a garage on morton!
ross,(panting)they're towing a car. and i am seeing...spots.
joey,(sounding panicky)oh my god ross! you don't have emma! and rachel you don't have emma! (starts yelling) where's emma? who has emma!?
rachel,joey relax! my mother picked her up two hours ago. you were there!
joey,(not yelling anymore)i was?
joey,i did?
rachel,she dropped off a casserole?
joey,oh yeah! the casserole lady.
monica,"(to ross)so, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?"
phoebe,"...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle; and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but i heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, ""merry christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"""
joey,"(impressed) wow, that was great! you really wrote that?"
phoebe,(smiling) uh-huh.
chandler,"(coming from the bedroom) say goodbye elves, i'm off to tulsa."
monica,i can't believe you're not gonna be here for christmas.
monica,hey hon? would you help me get the plates down?
chandler,yeah. hey! here's an idea. why don't we use our wedding china today?
monica,"no, i think we should save our china for something really special...like, if the queen of england comes over."
chandler,"honey, she keeps cancelling on us...take the hint!"
monica,what if something gets broken? they're so expensive!
chandler,"what is the point of having them, if we never use them?"
monica,"ok..but if something gets broken, and then the queen comes over..."
phoebe,oh hey ross oh i'm so glad someone's here could you zip me up?
ross,sure.
phoebe,thank you can you believe no one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me.
ross,"people (shakes head, they sit) so why you all dressed up."
phoebe,oh umm mike's picking me up for a date.
ross,"oh yea now um how is that going, is it getting serious?"
phoebe,"oh i dunno i dunno, you know i mean i like him but am i ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market."
ross,"you know i really admire your whole dating attitude, it's so healthy i'm always like is this moving to fast? is this moving to slow? where's this going?"
phoebe,yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.
monica,thank you!
monica,thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) you haven't said anything...
monica,oh..please!i-i welcome criticism.
monica,what musician?
phoebe,"(playing guitar and singing) and there's a country called argentinaaaa, it's a place i've never seeeeen. but i'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. humaaan spleeeeen. olè!"
monica,what are you doing here!
phoebe,"well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so i am here to entertain!"
monica,great!
phoebe,"yeah! it really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! yeah, ""you suck"" and ""shut up and go home""."
monica,listen phoebe...
chandler,"(picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog in his throat) hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog in his throat when he speaks again) hello?"
monica,"(in her apartment, screaming) i love my new job!"
chandler,"honey, you're screaming."
monica,you bet your ass i am! i just had the best first day ever! the kitchen: twice as big as allessandro's.
chandler,"(yawning) oh, that's great."
monica,"yeah, a-a-and clean. not just health department clean... monica clean."
phoebe,"oh hey you guys, i couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner thursday night instead."
joey,thursday? but that's halloween.
phoebe,so?
joey,"[it's just] so spooky, that's all."
ross,"so, so, is mike coming to dinner?"
phoebe,"no! it's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. uch, i get mad at him, but i think it's a little to soon to show my true colors."
rachel,"all right... oh, emma loves him!"
joey,why wouldn't she? he's a wonderful person!
phoebe,hi.
monica,hey phoebe... how you doin'? you feelin' better?
phoebe,"breaking up sucks! oh, i really miss mike!"
chandler,"oh, i'm so sorry!"
phoebe,"oh god, i tried everything to make myself feel better. i even tried writing a song about it... but... i can't think of anything that rhymes with aarrgghh!! (pause) hey monica, i really need your help getting through this..."
chandler,you're not gonna need my help?
phoebe,"well no, when i get to the point where... you know... i'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about mike... i'm gonna come to you."
chandler,"oh good, 'cause i've already thought of 3... 4! i've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)"
phoebe,"ok. i mean i know i did the right thing. you know, mike never wants to get married and i shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon i'm gonna miss him so much. i'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that."
monica,"ok, you got it!"
phoebe,"(after a pause) unless... maybe it's too crazy about this... alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. you know what? forget what i said."
rachel,"oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. just be calm. for all he knows we're just hanging out together. right? just be nonchalant. (joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) that's not nonchalant!"
joey,no idea what it means.
rachel,"oh... okay, just hide!"
ross,(knocks) rach?
rachel,"coming! try under the bed, try under the bed!"
rachel,there's no room under the bed. (looks around because she can't find joey anymore)
ross,is everything okay?
rachel,"yeah... (still looking to see where joey went, and opens the door)"
ross,hey.
rachel,hi...
joey,okay. what have we wanted to always do together?
chandler,braid each other’s hair then ride horseback on the beach?
joey,"no, no, no. when you get home tomorrow night, you and i are gonna be at the wizards – knicks game courtside!"
chandler,courtside? oh my god!!
joey,"yeah, maybe michael jordan will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee!"
chandler,that is so cool. i’ll let monica know.
monica,hello?
chandler,joey just called. he’s got courtside knicks tickets for me and him tomorrow night.
monica,really? but tomorrow night’s the only one i get off from the restaurant. if you go to the game then we won’t have another night together for a week.
chandler,but-t it’s courtside! the cheerleaders are gonna be right in … [mouths last words so monica does not hear them]. that’s not the way to convince you.
monica,"look. i don’t want to be one of those wives that says “you can’t go to the game”, “you have to spend time with me”, so, if you just realize it on your own?"
phoebe,oh god...we're really going to move in together!
phoebe,"i've always wanted to live with a guy..""pick up your socks!"" ""put down the toilet seat!"" ""no! we're not having sex anymore!"" it's gonna be fun!"
monica,hey joey!
joey,hey!
monica,listen...i need to know that what i'm about to ask you..will never get back to chandler.
joey,i'd be lying if i said i haven't thought about it myself...chandler is my best friend..it would be wrong. good...(he winks)...but wrong.
joey,awww..i don't know monica...you know...erm...lending friends money is always a mistake.
monica,but chandler lent you money!
joey,and i think he would tell you it was a mistake.
monica,come on...i just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
joey,oh...how much?
chandler,"hey, you must be owen."
chandler,"i'm chandler. hey, i was in the scouts too."
chandler,"yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother."
chandler,you know how to use a compass?
chandler,you do? that's fantastic!
chandler,"i'd love to, but i gotta get back to talking to your parents. they're telling us all about how they adopted you."
chandler,what?
chandler,i got nothing.
ross,"the first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood."
rachel,"well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some."
ross,"oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice."
ross,"oh, no, it's no big deal, i mean, if i weren't doing this i'd just, you know, be at the gym working out."
monica,(to chandler) is he gonna introduce us?
chandler,"(to monica) no, i think we're just blurry shapes to him now."
ross,"oh, ha, i wrote that in one minute."
monica,(to chandler) twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
ross,"(hitting monica with his suitcase) (to charlie) we should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover."
ross,i don't think so.
ross,"oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is ""if you can't come on time, then don't come at all"". (pause) an option that many of my students use. (pause) shall we?"
ross,"you know what, he's a big boy, i'm sure he'll find us, ok?"
joey,"enough said, i'm there for you man. where is she, upstairs?"
chandler,(stopping joey) ah-ha!
ross,how do you feel about all this?
chandler,i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don't think there is one.
joey,"come on ross, be a good guy. step up and do it!"
ross,(puzzled) what?
ross,(looking astonished) what? no! i am not going to give them ben!
ross,the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
ross,"(reading from a notepad) i mean, we've been accepting leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) so-so what i am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! i mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, i mean, truly the mind boggles!"
ross,"oh, that's not what you want..."
phoebe,"oh, i'll take some of that."
rachel,ok
rachel,(imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors.
rachel,alright-y then.
phoebe,"ok. do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (she sees rachel) oh, no, no! listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?"
phoebe,but that woman can't know i work here. she's a friend of mine and i made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
phoebe,'cause it's good money! but that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
phoebe,"(watching around and whispering) ok, are they listening?"
joey,ross!
monica,"well, what do you think of mike and chandler being in a car accident?"
phoebe,"(makes a face) are you kidding, i love it!"
phoebe,hi!
monica,hi!
monica,(beaming) yeah! yeah! his name is chandler and...
phoebe,musty!
monica,when were we not friends?
monica,"ehm, we were friends in 1992."
monica,(to phoebe) you were going to cut me out?
phoebe,"oh no, no, no. i learned never to borrow money from friends. no, that's why richard dreyfuss and i don't speak anymore."
joey,"oh, hey, how about this? wanna be an extra on my show?"
phoebe,you could do that?
joey,"yeah, yeah. the pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need."
phoebe,"oh my god, i'm gonna be on tv!"
joey,"okay, now. i gotta tell you, being on tv isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think."
phoebe,"oh, really?"
joey,no it is awesome!
ross,hi guys.
phoebe,"wow! hey, why are you all dressed up?"
ross,rachel and i are bringing emma to ralph lauren today to introduce her to everyone. doesn't she look cute?
ross,"it's a blanket joe, not a cloak of invisibility!"
ross,(very excited) look at all these paleontologists!!
joey,"i know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! (a woman goes towards them)"
joey,"(to charlie) i think i've been recognized, this happens all the time!"
joey,that... never happens...
ross,"wow! this is very flattering, uh..."
ross,"uh, uh... sure! um... ""dear..."" (he takes the notepad)"
ross,"""... sarah. i dig you"", uh? ""doctor ross geller""."
ross,"yeah, oh and sarah... i'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, professor wheeler, a-and this is joey tribbiani."
joey,"no, god, no! no! no no, i'm an actor. you'd probably recognize me from a little show called ""the days of our lives""."
phoebe,"(looks relieved) oh, yeah i know. that’s bob."
phoebe,"well not so much a pet, as, you know, an occasionally visitor who i put food out for…you know…kinda like santa…except santa doesn’t poof on a plate of cookies."
phoebe,what are those?
phoebe,"ok fine. if it means that much to you, i’ll get rid of bob."
phoebe,so weird. you think he’s so gross yet you’re willing to eat his crackers. [mike desperately tries to get rid of crackers in his mouth. his uses his hand to clean his tongue.]
rachel,hello
rachel,"gavin, i just want to say thanks you again for watching emma yesterday during the presentation. i really owe you an apology."
phoebe,your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
joey,oh man! i have to get those done too?!
phoebe,wow! talking about high maintenance
joey,hey hey! you dye your hair!
phoebe,i'm a woman!
joey,arghhh! double standards!
phoebe,"oh before i forget, are you coming to mike's piano bar tonight?"
monica,only if i don't have to get up and sing.
phoebe,"but everybody sings. it's so much fun! last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out"
monica,"it's just, i'm not good at singing."
phoebe,oh! what's the matter? are you scared? you're afraid i'm a better singer? you're afraid i'm gonna beat you at singing?
monica,"no no, it's not working on me. wow! i must be growing up!"
ross,"yeah, uh... and then i figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!"
chandler,"(hysterical)don't touch the phone! i'll get it, i'll get it, i'll get it!! (picks up the phone)"
ross,(to monica)think he washed his hands?
chandler,"(into receiver)hello? hey charlie, what do you know?"
rachel,(to monica)what's going on?
monica,"chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. but out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three."
joey,ooh! tough odds!
ross,(mockingly)yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
joey,(smiling)look who's coming around!
chandler,(still on the phone)damnit. alright call me when you know more.
joey,(excited)did you get it?
ross,you're really not coming back?
chandler,"yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. if i don't get it done, i'll be fired."
monica,"it's so unfair, you don't even like your job!"
chandler,"so, who does?"
phoebe,"oh, i like my job."
joey,i *love* my job.
rachel,"yeah, i can't *wait* to go back to work."
ross,i can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
chandler,i'm sorry i won't be here.
monica,"it's just... it's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, i understand."
chandler,thanks. (they kiss) i'll see you new year's day.
monica,(shocked) you're not gonna be here new year's eve??
chandler,i will explain it to her.
monica,oh yeah! like i'm going to let you talk to the queen.
joey,wow the parade is really good this year/man those horses can crap! [looks sideways at the tv in disgust]
chandler,muskogee? that's like four hours from tulsa! woo hoo!
joey,oh my god!!
chandler,aren't you one of the stars of popular daytime soap days of our lives?
joey,yeah!! i forgot i'm supposed to be there! i can't believe i forgot! i usually write stuff like this down on my arm!
joey,oh! stupid long sleeves!
chandler,what are you going to do?
joey,"(sighs) i guess i'm going to come up with a really good reason why i wasn't there! the producer is going to be so mad at me...he sat us all down yesterday and said everyone has to be there six am sharp, that means you tribbiani! (shrugs) like i was some kind of idiot!"
chandler,"well, you proved them wrong."
ross,"but you, your so much better off you just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious."
phoebe,"i wouldn't say never, you know there's that guy (pause) well what about (pause) ok well there's gotta be someone."
ross,there isn't that's what i'm saying. (all happy)
phoebe,oh my god you're right.
ross,i know and yet here you are all ready for the next date.
phoebe,"i can't believe i never realized this before, i'm in my thirty's and never been in a long-term relationship oh my god (starts crying) what's wrong with me."
ross,"no, no, no there's nothing wrong with you i mean you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway."
phoebe,i wanna get married (grabs a tissue)
ross,"please don't cry because of me pheebs i don't know what i'm talking about, i've been divorced three times."
phoebe,"least you've been married, oh my god! i wanna trade lives with ross (cries more)"
phoebe,"nothing, i'm excited about our date, mike this is ross geller this is mike haaaaa (starts crying)"
phoebe,yeah.
monica,"you know how much i love listening to your music, you know, but..."
phoebe,but what?
monica,this is kind of a classy place.
phoebe,"(pause) ok, say no more."
phoebe,"(with a fancy dress, still playing and singing): it wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! everyone! it wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to monica, showing her dress) classy, uh?"
chandler,(clearly not so interested) awesome.
monica,"oh, and the people are so nice. there's this one guy, geoffrey, he's the maitre d., chandler, you will love him. he is without a doubt, the funniest guy i have ever met. (chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)"
phoebe,"i know! (phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want to let go of mike's hand. she tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)"
phoebe,"yeah, i kinda do. (mike lets go of her hand) well, how's this? (she takes mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. after that, they hold hands again. joey now enters, and sees the two sitting on the couch, holding hands.)"
joey,"(in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (phoebe and mike, embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) have you not talked about it yet? (they say nothing now, but smile) am i making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to mike) if you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)"
phoebe,i'm sorry... i'm sorry. it's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
phoebe,"(in a flash she answers) maybe not, is it?"
phoebe,"(impatient) i know mike, why don't you keep digging?"
rachel,"pheebs, i would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch emma. (to ross:) which one of us should go to dinner?"
phoebe,"oh, rachel!"
ross,"actually, um, i was thinking maybe both of us could go."
phoebe,"oh, yay!"
ross,"thanks, i put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift."
phoebe,"alright, okay, so we can all go now. that is fun. hey, you know what? we all haven't been together the six of us in such a long time."
monica,what are you talking about? we're all together right now.
rachel,"um, mon, chandler's not here."
monica,"oh, dear god!"
chandler,"good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. now, before we get started, are there any questions? (colleague raises hand) yes, ken is it?"
chandler,"(laughs) well, don't believe everything you hear, ken. (both turning away to files) but yeah, that's true. alright, let's get started, by take a look at last quarter's figures. (the female next to chandler starts smoking, towards heross:) ah, claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?"
chandler,"no, no, no-no-no. i smoked for years, then i quit. right now, i can't remember why. (to everyone:) you're not allowed to smoke in this office. not right?"
monica,really? if that's what you want...
phoebe,that was a test and you just failed.
monica,damn it! rookie mistake!
ross,(yelling at chandler) i have sex with dinosaurs??
chandler,i believe i read that somewhere!
ross,"that only is not funny, it's physically impossible! ok? depending on the species i'd have to have a six foot long... (pause) it's not funny!!"
chandler,i respectfully disagree.
ross,i can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
chandler,who cares? nobody reads those things
ross,you'd better hope not because i just read what you put on your page today.
chandler,i don't have a page.
ross,you know where joey is?
rachel,...i really don't... (looks around again)
ross,can i talk to you for a minute?
rachel,"yeah, sure... (looks outside into the corridor if joey is there)"
joey,i don't believe this... have you guys been...
phoebe,shhh... this is the listening side of the wall.
ross,"and then she told me that she and joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me."
rachel,(clearly not listening and still trying to find out where joey went) uh-huh... right... yeah...
ross,and you know i wanted to ask charlie out since the day i met her.
rachel,"(still searching) oh, i know... i know it's been really hard for you."
ross,"anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. i mean, how angry do you think joey is gonna be?"
chandler,i…i…i know. you’re right. i wanna see you too. i’ve just got to figure out a way to tell joey. he’s really looking forward to this.
monica,[on phone] tell him you haven’t seen your wife in a long time. [in apartment] tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. tell him that…what little time that we have is precious.
chandler,"yeah, yeah, yeah. i’ll think of something."
ross,"wow! you look…er…hm……i mean, it’s just the…er…that, that dress! er…"
rachel,i hope the ends of these sentences are good!
ross,"no, no…they’re good. it’s just been so long since i’ve seen you like this. you clean up good!"
rachel,"ahh. [looks down] well, thank you! ha-ha! [ross continues to stare at rachel] okay – stop looking at me like that. the last time that happened [pointing towards ross’s crotch] that happened [pointing at emma]"
ross,"oh, right! [looking away]"
ross,"so, are you. ah! are you excited about your…er…first night away from emma?"
rachel,"yeah! phoebe and i are gonna have so much fun! thank you for watching the baby, by the way."
monica,two thousand dollars?
joey,two thousand dollars!? what do you think i am? i soap oprea star!?
monica,yeah...
joey,that's right i am! (opens drawer and rummages through it. rachel enters)
rachel,hi you guys!
joey,oo...what's in the bag?
rachel,"oh er..well you know emma started crawling? i realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. so i went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment."
joey,"oh...baby-proofing...why is this such a big deal now? y'know..when i was a kid it was like.. ""whoops! joey fell down the stairs!"" or er.. ""whoops! joey electrocuted himself again!"" huh!"
monica,anyway erm..are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
rachel,no. i was just going to do this myself. (joey makes a sarcastic laugh.)
joey,you're gonna do it?
ross,"oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? you know? just the four of us. just hangin'."
joey,"dude, are you okay? and when are the fajitas gonna be ready?"
ross,"i'm fine! hey, i'm great! i'm just.. i'm just proud of us. there's no weirdness, no tension."
rachel,no awareness.
ross,"we make a great foursome. we should do more stuff together. ooh! let's take a trip. okay, where do you think we - we can go?"
ross,my fajitas!!
rachel,"look, charlie, i just want you to know. ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of joey and me. you know, he normally doesn't drink like this."
ross,"fajitas! be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!"
rachel,"ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!"
ross,that is gonna hurt tomorrow!
phoebe,"okay, well, this is crazy. can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?"
ross,"oh, damn it!"
joey,(entering the room) hey!
rachel,hey!
joey,what's happenin'?
rachel,"yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight."
joey,"oh, i'd love to, but i gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first"
rachel,"oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine)"
joey,(yelling) stupid jane rogers!!
rachel,(angry) you are having a party tonight??
joey,kinda have a... a thing for the days of our life's people.
rachel,"pheebs, that's for men!"
phoebe,"no, i know, this way when i go to the party later mike will know i am over him cause i'm gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) yeah."
phoebe,"ok. oh good, i'm dating a russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). seriously does anyone buy this? i smell like beets!"
rachel,"on melanie griffith in ""working girl"". i think what you want is over here."
rachel,really?
rachel,"oh, i can't. because i-i've seen them."
rachel,"yeah! i'm a big fan! of the movies, you know. motion pictures. the talkies!"
phoebe,"(picks up a dress) hey rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?"
rachel,sure!
phoebe,ok!
rachel,you know that depends on what it is! i've done a lot of stuff.
ross,hi!
joey,i need to talk to you about charlie.
ross,"(annoyed) oh, do you, do you really?"
joey,"yeah, i'm... i'm kind of having a little problem."
ross,"look, if you don't know what the word ""acrimonious"" means, just don't use it!"
joey,"no, look, you know charlie, right? she's cool, she's funny, her body is soo..."
ross,get to the problem!
joey,yes. it's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls i've ever dated! combined! i don't want her to think i'm stupid!
ross,(looking down) are you wearing two belts?
joey,"(checking) eh, what do you know!"
ross,you were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
joey,"right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and i don't know how to talk about that stuff. you gotta help me out!"
phoebe,well...kinda.
monica,oh my god!
phoebe,"yeah well, in america you're just an ""ass""."
monica,"(into the phone) hello? chandler, what's wrong? (she listens) oh my god, are you alright? (listens some more) yeah, i'll be right there. (she hangs up and speaks to amanda) i'm so sorry, but chandler was in a car accident. (she gets up)"
phoebe,(also gets up and starts taking her purse) oh my god. was mike with him?
monica,nope! (she turns and leaves)
joey,(to rachel) hey!
rachel,hey! got champagne?
joey,"yes ma'am, ready to power through!"
rachel,"excellent! stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (starts to remove her bra from under her clothes)..."
joey,uh! (when she's done she throws her bra at him)
rachel,"ok (starts to light some candles) sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. (claps her hands and jumps at joey, clearly very excited) alright! lets do it!"
joey,she sure does. why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
rachel,"well, because if one more person says ""what a cute little boy"" i'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!"
ross,"i think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? she's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and a-line skirts. can i get a blue bow?"
monica,"(flipping through bunch of folders as chandler enters from bathroom) okay, i have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision."
chandler,how long was i in there?
monica,okay. let us start with the a's. advertising.
chandler,wait. advertising! that's a great idea!
monica,don't you want to look through the rest?
chandler,"i don't think i have to hear the rest. advertising makes perfect sense. sorry you had to waste all this time, though."
monica,"you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? ooh, now i get to use my shredder!"
ross,"dude, it's just ""days of our lives""... there's no the."
joey,"(thinking he's kidding) ok, ross! it's... it's fun, yeah! no, i-i play doctor drake ramoray."
joey,you don't own a tv? what's all your furniture pointed at??
monica,"david, can you help me?! i'm trying to explain to chandler how a plane stays in the air."
monica,(to chandler) see?
chandler,"yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind""."
monica,"alright, i'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip."
phoebe,"oh, i should go, too. oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should mike and i just meet you there."
phoebe,mike?? who's mike?
phoebe,"that's right! oh, yeah... well, i've totally forgotten about im! ah! that's-that's... a blast from the past!"
phoebe,"really, it doesn't mean anything. i mean, you know, monica refers to chandler as richard all the time!"
chandler,(upset) she does?
rachel,"well when we first met, you know i thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious."
rachel,"no i just mean that you know, first impression don’t mean anything. and i think you are a really good guy. and i’m sorry that i misjudge you."
rachel,hey (turning around to place her documents)
rachel,"you know what, hey, new day, new leave, i am just really really happy(she turned around to see gaving looking at heather’s butt.)…i’m sorry. obviously heather’s ass has something more important to say so i will just wait till it’s finish."
rachel,i was giving you an apology and you were totally checking her out.
rachel,"ow, you are really, really a creep."
rachel,why do you even care if i was looking at her? are you jealous?
rachel,"oh yeah! (sarcastic) i’m jealous. oh gavin, please, please look at my ass."
rachel,stop looking at my ass.
rachel,"i mean i just think you are totally inappropriate, ok. this is a working environment. she is your subordinate"
phoebe,ok fine! please come and support mike. you don't have to sing.
monica,so i don't have to sing and i can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
phoebe,while drinking...
monica,i'm there!
rachel,hi guys! listen i really need your help. i think i did something really stupid.
phoebe,well yes rachel but you got something so beautiful out there
rachel,no not that. i kissed gavin last night.
phoebe,oh my god.
monica,you kissed him?
rachel,"yeah. it was after the party, we were on the balcony and..."
monica,wait wait wait. i was at home the whole time. how did i missed that?
chandler,one of the slots got filled.
joey,(still excited)by you!?
chandler,sense the tone! no that kid nate got it.
monica,oh! i hate that guy! i mean come on kid! pull up your pants!
chandler,yeah i know.
rachel,"well, there's two spots left right?"
chandler,"yeah...i mean i want this so much! i mean, i wanna get one, i want my friend charlie to get one...except i don't care about charlie."
phoebe,"(excited)hey you guys! ok, you're not going to believe this! i just saw my psychic and she said i was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!"
monica,"hey that reminds me, i thought we could use some extra luck so i brought a wishbone home from work."
ross,(mockingly)a psychic and a wishbone? guys! give someone else a chance!
monica,"alright, who wants to do it?"
phoebe,"oh can i? vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. it's really not fair either! you know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!"
chandler,did i not mention that?
monica,no!
chandler,"(thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming:) ...and to all a good night! (and runs out of the apartment)"
chandler,"all right everybody, i know that it's christmas eve and you'd rather be with your familys, but there's *no* call (he takes it off) for writing ""screw you, mr. bing!"" on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) -- by the way, you can all call me chandler."
chandler,hey. where've you been?
chandler,"(to the others) you hear that? you may not be with your familys, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here."
chandler,"y'know what, i know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) i had a little talk with the boys in new york, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little christmas bonus may be in order."
chandler,"well, that's like money in your pocket! - alright look, you want me to say it? this sucks. being here sucks! this work sucks!"
joey,yeah...
rachel,oh emma...this is your first thanksgiving...what are you thankful for? mommy's boobies?
ross,alot of people are thankful for those!
rachel,who is it?
rachel,hide my rings...
rachel,hey amy!! happy thanksgiving!
rachel,erm...hi! (opens arms wide in an embrace)
rachel,i haven't seen you in like a year!
rachel,oh...me too! erm..i had a baby...
rachel,"oh..yeah? well, unless you pushed a desk of your vagina, not the same thing."
ross,i'm sorry i didn't catch…
ross,oh ross geller
phoebe,uh huh (terns to ross) how do i look (all her make up has gone everywhere)
ross,do you have a compact in your purse?
phoebe,(goes to cry) no
ross,you look great.
monica,hey joey
joey,"hey, this girl won't turn around and i can't tell whether she's hot or not, what do you think?"
monica,joey i am not going to objectify woman with you (looks at the woman) but if her face is as nice as her ass woah mamma.
joey,"alright thanks, oh hey have you talked to chandler?"
monica,yeah he has to stay in tulsa this weekend
joey,how come?
chandler,"hi, chandler bing, i have a reservation."
chandler,new york.
ross,(in a strange voice and eating candies) the big apple!
chandler,"i'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here."
ross,"yeah, i ate all my gifts for everybody."
chandler,"well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?"
ross,(high pitched voice) check again please!
ross,not there.
chandler,"let me get this straight. i called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and i was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?"
ross,(mumbling) she doesn't know what to say!
phoebe,"oh, it's a key. to be honest, i think i'd prefer the five dollars."
phoebe,"(really surprised) oh wow, ooh! ooh, big step for phoebe and mike."
phoebe,"oh no, i want to."
phoebe,"yeah... ooh... wow... even started to think i'd never meet someone that, you know, i wanted to... do this with. here you go. (both phoebe and mike look really proud.)"
phoebe,it really is.
joey,"(sitting at his table) oh, i know it... it is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with his own keys, phoebe looks at him in a ""yeah, yeah, yeah"" way.)"
rachel,"so i don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that emma could get a chance to know her."
rachel,"that's great, great. so do you have any questions for us?"
rachel,allright. well thank you so much for coming... (they're standing up and make their way to the door)
chandler,"alright, lo...look. i don't smoke anymore. but if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. (everyone lits) so you all smoke then? that's almost rude, that i'm not."
chandler,"(loud) ken, please! no, i can't, i can't smoke. if i smoke, my wife would kill me."
chandler,"i always liked you, ken. (takes a cig)"
phoebe,"(from outside) trick or treat! (it's obviously halloween eve, the night of her birthday dinner.)"
monica,(opening the door) hey!
phoebe,"ooh, and treat it is. (monica's breasts.)"
monica,hmhmm. (ties up)
phoebe,"wow, so glad i changed. almost weared my ??? outfit that can't contain my breasts."
monica,"this is not, what i'm wearing. i'm ovulating and chandler's gonna be home any minute, so i thought we would try before dinner."
phoebe,"ohh. oh wait! (jis) you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you?"
monica,"believe me, chandler and i have not seen each other in over a week. we'll probably be the first ones there."
ross,oh oh oh! i respectfully disagree!!
joey,"look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up hugsy) it's okay, emma, you stay asleep. (emma cries)"
rachel,"(threatening joey with a scrunchy): step away from the crib, i have a weapon!"
joey,"it's okay, it's okay rach, it's me. put down the scrunchy."
rachel,what are you doing?
joey,"well, i heard emma stirring, so i came to make sure she could reach hugsy."
rachel,"oh, oh thanks. alright well, now that i'm up i'm going to go to the bathroom."
joey,(placing hugsy back in the crib) there you go sweetie... (to emma) this isn't over.
monica,"alright, wait a second, why would ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... (reads from the screen) ""gay as the day is long""?"
chandler,because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
monica,but that's clearly a joke. this could easily be true. (phone rings)
chandler,would you get that please? people have been calling to congratulate me all day.
monica,"(on the phone) hello? no, he's not here. yeah, this is his wife. yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. i guess i should have known. yeah, i mean, he just kept making me watch moulin rouge."
rachel,"(now looking up at the ceiling) that is hard to say, ross. that is hard to say."
ross,"you know, i gotta go find him. he's gotta be here someplace."
rachel,you would think!
rachel,joey!
joey,is he gone?
rachel,(still can't find him) how are you doing this?
joey,pssst...
rachel,how... wha... hey! what are you... what is this? have you guys been listening this entire time?
phoebe,"now, what is this?"
rachel,"ah, what is this? well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so i guess this is sixth grade!"
ross,"oh, it’s fine. actually, i…i invited mike over"
rachel,phoebe’s mike?
ross,yeah.
rachel,i didn’t know that you guys hung out.
ross,"we don’t. but, i thought that it would be nice to get to know him. you know? we have a little dinner, drinks, conversation."
rachel,awww. that’s so cute! ross and mike’s first date! [beat] is that going to be awkward? what are you guys gonna talk about?
ross,"well, but, you know, we have a lot in common, you know, erm…he plays the piano, i played keyboards in college, or, he’s been divorced, i have…some…experience in that area"
rachel,yeah?
phoebe,hi!
phoebe,"ooh. you’re first night out, indeed!"
rachel,"okay, so now i think emma is properly down for the night but if you need anything ross…[pointing finger into his chest]"
ross,"rach, rach, rach: we’ll be fine. you go have fun."
rachel,yeah...why? you don't think a woman can do this?
joey,oh...women can. you..can't.
rachel,monica...would you please tell joey that he is a pig?
monica,you're a pig. and you can't do this.
rachel,wha!? what!? come on! i found the hardware store all by myself!
joey,the hardware store is right down the street.
rachel,there is a hardware store right down the street?
phoebe,hey you guys! ok..we've got great news.
phoebe,i know it's so exciting! you know i've never lived with a guy before.
monica,"well you know it's just like living with a girl. only they don't steal your makeup. unless...they're playing ""this is what my sister would look like""..(looks at chandler)"
chandler,yeah...she's not so cute.
phoebe,insane.
phoebe,"alice would never go for it, right?"
phoebe,"well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. which one would you be willing to give up?"
phoebe,frank jr.jr.?
phoebe,uh-huh.
phoebe,"well, alright, that's fine. what about leslie?"
phoebe,"alright, so that leaves chandler."
phoebe,"wow, frank. i think we just ran out of kids."
phoebe,"i'm sorry, frank. i didn't realise things were so bad. you know, i'll help out more. i can - i can babysit any time you want. you name the day, and i'll be there."
rachel,and you weren't going to tell us? how did you think you were gonna get away with that?
joey,i do it every year.
rachel,you do that every year??
joey,i didn't have to tell you that!! i'm stupider than jane rogers!!
rachel,"oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??"
joey,yeah...
rachel,and last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
joey,yeah...
rachel,"oh! and the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?"
joey,(smiling) i can't believe you guys went for that one!
rachel,"joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?"
joey,"you're fine, ok? but everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!"
rachel,"well, then so you just invite me...!"
phoebe,"so what were you doing out there, do you not like charlie?"
rachel,"she's ok, i just don't get a really good vibe from her!"
phoebe,why?
rachel,"i don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! you know, and just swept joey off his feet... i mean, nobody else has a chance!"
phoebe,who else?
rachel,"anybody! you, me, you know, monica's mom..."
phoebe,you like joey?
rachel,"shhhhh! phoebe! all right, look. i have a little thing for him."
phoebe,(whispering) oh my god!
rachel,"it's just physical and i have it totally under control! ok? it's just, when i see them together, sometimes i just get a little jealous!"
phoebe,"uh, wow! isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?"
rachel,"(annoyed) oh, i get it!"
ross,"you know, i really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship."
joey,"please, c'mon, you're the smartest person i know and i really like this girl, ok, i don't wanna lose her."
ross,(after a short hesitation) fine.
joey,thanks.
ross,"ok. let's see. oh, you should take her to the met!"
joey,the metsss!
ross,"oh, no! the met! the metropolitan museum of art."
joey,"(realizing) oh, that's what she meant! (pause) you know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the muse! you know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!"
ross,"yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!"
joey,"ok, all right, so i'll take her to the met."
ross,"yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on madison avenue. you know what? she loves architecture, you know what you should do? you should take a walk down fifth to the saint patrick's cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love."
joey,"geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!"
ross,but i'm not! (pause). you know what if you're in the mood for thai food...
joey,"ok, you're scaring me a little bit."
rachel,"oh! get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (she pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) ok. aha! you like that huh?"
joey,oh! yeah!
rachel,"you like that? (she climbs on the barcalounger seductively, putting her knees next to joey's hips.) let's take this into high gear (she pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. she puts one of her knees between his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)"
joey,uh uh!
rachel,"yeah baby, i'll show you how we do it!"
joey,"no, no, no! you kneed me in my misters!"
rachel,what? oh my god! i'm so sorry. joey? are you ok?
joey,"(he just sits there, legs very close together with a painful look on his face) soldier down!"
monica,we are not friends with phoebe anymore.
chandler,"if she asks, i protested a little, but ok!"
phoebe,"oh chandler! thank god you're alive. monica, can i talk to you outside for a minute?"
chandler,"i mean, i can write slogans. i mean, how hard can it be, right? ""cheese. it's milk that you chew."" ""crackers. because your cheese needs a buddy."" ""a grape. because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"""
monica,"i got one. ""socks. because your family's feet deserve the best."""
chandler,honey? leave it to the pros.
monica,i actually know someone in advertising. i grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. maybe i can get him to meet you? give me the phone.
chandler,"""the phone. bringing you closer to people...who have phones."""
monica,"""marriage. it's not for everybody."""
rachel,that went well. almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
ross,"yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread."
rachel,i'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . (to the guy behind her desk) who the hell are you!?
rachel,i'm the hell person whose office this is!
ross,"good one, rach."
rachel,excuse me?
phoebe,"joey, look at me! i'm a nurse!"
monica,(pinching her) let's get you out of here!! (they go outside)
monica,at least you took me down with you!
phoebe,"i'm sooo sorry!! i just... i keep thinking about mike! i'm crazy about david, and we're having so much fun together. why-why do i miss mike? that's-that's gonna go away, right?"
monica,"i guess, in time."
phoebe,yeah.
monica,"i mean, my feelings for richard are certainly gone."
phoebe,"you just did it again. chandler, your feelings for chandler are certainly gone!"
chandler,i wouldn't read too much into it.
chandler,"david, let me stop you there 'cause i think i see where this is going. i'm not very good at giving advice. so if you want advice, go to ross, monica, or... joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee."
chandler,"seriously, we're gonna do this?"
rachel,"that is totally different for two reasons. one. i didn’t know that you knew that… and two, i wasn’t some creep staring at his ass. we had a…we had a deep, meaningful relationship."
rachel,"it was…(staring at the air, thinking)…oh my god…he didn’t…he didn’t have a last name. it was just…just tag. you know, like cher, or you know…moses."
rachel,"(turned around, looking angry, mumbling) oh what are you his boyfriend..."
joey,"man, i wish i had a nanny like you."
joey,sure!
monica,would you stop staring at her?
chandler,(staring at molly) i wasn’t staring. i was leering.
monica,what’s the big deal with her? maybe she’s attractive in an obvious kind of way.
ross,"yeah, obvious beauty is the worst. you know, when it’s right there in your face. me, i like i have to work to find someone attractive, makes me feel like i earned it."
chandler,so joey is doing alright with her (ross quickly turns to see).
phoebe,"it was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper."
monica,oh yeah...so how did you end up kissing?
rachel,"you know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf..."
monica,i thought you hated him?
rachel,"you know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!"
monica,so are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
rachel,"i don't know. it's so complicated. i work with this guy, you know, i have the baby, and i have ross, and i just...i don't"
monica,"sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to gavin, and you definitely should talk to ross"
rachel,or...i could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
phoebe,"wow! five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!"
joey,hey. i'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
joey,chandler bing.
monica,"ok, hey rach?"
rachel,"oh no, i'm good, i don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands."
joey,i'll do it!! it'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
phoebe,i hope i win!
monica,"well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?"
joey,i can't tell you what i'm wishing for! else...you know...won't come true!
monica,"right! .. but we ""know"" what you're wishing for!"
joey,can't really say!
monica,"i understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?"
joey,(slightly irritated)i'm not really comfortable with these questions!
chandler,"i'm sorry. hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your familys tonight. i have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. and then tomorrow morning, you get to have christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to."
chandler,"haha, no thanks!"
chandler,"oh, thanks! i'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker."
chandler,"typical christmas-y stuff, you know? our holidays are pretty traditional..."
phoebe,"so here is a, a very special holiday song that i wrote for some very important people to me."
rachel,"okay, pheebs, you look in the kitchen, i will look in the back closet."
chandler,"i can save you time ladies, i'm right here."
phoebe,"yeah, chandler why don't you take a walk? this doesn't concern you."
rachel,er..it's emma[emphasizing on emma]
ross,hey amy.
rachel,"oh amy, you remember ross."
ross,that was me. [rachel laughs in her throat]
ross,still me.
monica,careful. careful.. careful!
chandler,"i'll tell you what. for the rest of our lives, i'll be careful, until told otherwise."
chandler,wait a minute. this isn't the china we picked out...
monica,i know! after you left the store i chose different ones.
chandler,why?
monica,"he has to work, there's some rush on the big (pause, thinks) ah damn it one of these days i'm really gonna have to start listening when he talks about his job."
joey,oh why don't you fly out there and surprise him.
monica,maybe i will go (thinks) yea will have a second honeymoon at the tulsa romana.
joey,oh and you know what you should bring the black see-through teddy with the attached garters. (nods)
monica,how do you know i have one of those?
joey,didn't till just now.
joey,hot not hot (she turns around) hot!
joey,i said i think you're hot and now i'm embarrassed.
joey,"that would've been better, i'll try that hi i'm joey."
chandler,just give us the cheapest room you have.
chandler,that's insane!
ross,"totally insane. dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves."
chandler,does that room have a closet i can lock him in? (pause) we'll take it.
chandler,"(aside, to ross) what!? they are totally ripping us off!"
ross,"dude, don't worry 'bout it! i know how we can make your money back! this is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! like those apples. instead of taking one, i'm... i take six!"
chandler,"great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!"
ross,"c'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!"
chandler,"dude, you're shaking!"
ross,"i think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?"
ross,thank you.
rachel,really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
ross,"boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that."
rachel,okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face while ross crumples up the application form) wow! we're never gonna find a nanny.
ross,"oh, come on rach, we will. i promise. we have more interviews (they sit down and rachel sighs) and worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with."
rachel,"(indignant) what, the blonde with no bra?"
ross,"she was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but then gets a ""gotcha"" expression on his face... there's knocking at the door.) just a sec.! okay, okay. this one's name is sandy. she's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years."
rachel,okay... (ross opens the door.)
ross,and she's a little mannish...
phoebe,(gasps) oh my god! david!
phoebe,"'kay, see you there. happy humping! (outside meeting chandler.) hey...hey! oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? oh my god, don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?"
chandler,"actually, in oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people."
phoebe,you smoked!
chandler,"no! i just happened t'do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. for example, in hawaii cigarettes are called leyhallalookoos."
phoebe,"(smells at him) chandler, you stink of cigarettes."
chandler,"uch, do you think, monica is gonna be able smell it?"
phoebe,are you kidding? the woman has the nose of a bloodhound ... and the breasts of a great goddess.
chandler,pheebs?
phoebe,(embarrassed) i'm gonna go. (leaves to stairs)
chandler,"(getting in) okay, something to cover the smell ... oven cleaner! (sprays himself, reads label) unscented!"
monica,(naughty in doorway) welcome home. i've missed you. join me in the bedroom?
chandler,"no thanks, i'm good."
chandler,"hang up, hang up. and that was a great movie! (monica hangs up) i'm so gonna get back at ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something)."
monica,what are you doing?
chandler,"oh, you'll see my friend."
ross,(visibly upset) i'm dead?
chandler,(faking sympathy) and so young.
ross,posting that i died? that really isn't funny.
chandler,"well, how you died was funny."
ross,"oh please, hit by a blimp?"
chandler,it kills over one americans every year.
ross,"unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think i'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. you're messing with people's feelings here."
chandler,you wanna talk about people's feelings? you should have heard how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i wouldn't be able to go with him to key west!
ross,"you've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause i'm on my way to buy some photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. that's right! your coming out is about to get real graphic."
phoebe,"god, i wish mike were here."
phoebe,oh no... have you thought about it how complicated this could get? what about ross?
joey,"well, he's with charlie now."
monica,"yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. and as his friend, i mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?"
joey,"(long pause and he twitches a bit) you're a pain in my ass, geller!"
rachel,"all right, look you guys... look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between joey and me and i think we can handle it..."
chandler,"okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? the people that care about you?"
rachel,sure...
chandler,enunciate!
rachel,get out!
rachel,are they right?
rachel,okay. you too. and i hope you score.
rachel,bye [to mike]
ross,"so, welcome!"
ross,i’ve got bottled breast milk.
ross,okay
ross,"so, phoebe tells me you, er, play the piano?"
ross,"you, you know? i used to play the keyboards in college."
ross,no
ross,"erm, you know, i’m divorced. er, phoebe said you’ve been divorced."
phoebe,ok...well you put down the toilet seat.
monica,is that a bit you guys do?
phoebe,uh huh...we're playing you two.
monica,we don't do that! tell her we don't do that!
chandler,yes dear.
ross,i can't believe you guys are moving in together. that's..that's great! i mean...i'm happy for you guys..
monica,i hear wedding bells.
phoebe,monica slow down! ok? i'm just excited to be living with him. you know i mean..i don't know..can i see someday being married to mike? sure! yeah..you know..i can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. but do i want that house in connecticut...you know..near the good schools where mike and i can send sophie and mike junior.. oh my god i do.
ross,phoebe...i had no idea you were so conventional.
phoebe,i know! i guess i am! oh my god! load up the volvo i want to be a soccer mom!
phoebe,yeah! you bet roomy!
monica,don't you mean..groomy?
phoebe,"well, that's not good. but you know, i can move some stuff around, and i'll be there. you and alice just take the whole day together."
phoebe,are you kidding? that's what sisters are for.
chandler,where are bill and colleen?
monica,they're in the kitchen getting something to eat. can you believe how nice they are?
chandler,we have to leave!!
monica,why? what did you do in the bathroom?
chandler,"i didn't get to the bathroom. i bumped into owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. and there's a slight chance i may have told him."
monica,"oh my god, where's my purse? no, you know what? i can replace everything in there. get that binder, and let's go!"
chandler,but kids are so intuitive. don't you think on some level he already knows?
joey,"(speaking aloud) please, i was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!"
rachel,"oh, joey, come on! please, please! let me come, i will behave, i promise! i will behave! please, please, please..."
joey,"ok, ok! fine! you can come, but don't tell anybody else. it's up on the roof at 8."
rachel,"(yelling and jumping like a child) oh, a soap opera roof party!! i'm going to a soap opera roof party!! oh my god, oh my god!! (realizing how she's behaving) and it's out of my system!"
ross,"(very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to charlie) so, where did you get your undergraduate degree?"
ross,"(to charlie) oh, it's not over!"
ross,so basically all nuts?
ross,i've lost the will to live.
ross,what?
phoebe,"oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right."
rachel,"i know, i know, so it is just not a big deal."
phoebe,yeah.
rachel,so can we keep this between us?
phoebe,sure!
rachel,"ok, great, because i gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!"
phoebe,oh.
phoebe,any chance charlie has a deaf twin?
monica,hi honey!
chandler,"hey! look i brought a friend for dinner, this is zack, from work!"
monica,"oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, zack!"
joey,"whoa, whoa, whoa! slow down, you go way too fast. ok? just go back to the met, ok?"
ross,ok.
joey,you got to tell me exactly what to do there.
ross,"ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. ancient egypt, mesopotamia, up to the byzantine empire."
joey,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! so, i walk in the door and make the right (and he bends his arm to the left. ross then bends joey's arm to the right and joey nods)"
chandler,i have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) how do i know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
monica,"because, honey, i mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that."
chandler,"deposit my specimen? you know, usually i have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. thanks, got it."
monica,"hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?"
chandler,"yeah, i guess!"
monica,"i know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! no one here even knows you!"
monica,i have nothing to say to you.
phoebe,"please, monica? in the hall?"
chandler,"well, aren't you a treat."
monica,"i can't believe you tried to cut me out. why phoebe, why?"
phoebe,"it was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? you were really controlling and compulsive and shrill."
monica,i'm still all those things!
phoebe,you're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
monica,(starts smiling) i am scrappy.
phoebe,"exactly! look, no matter what i tried to do, i couldn't keep you out of my life. of all the people i have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in."
monica,it's because i'm scrappy.
joey,"yes you are. i think it may be time for my sponge bath. sorry, i'm just so used to hitting on the extras. so, are you excited about your scene?"
phoebe,yeah! but i'm a little shaky and nervous.
joey,"oh, relax. don't be. you'll be fine, you'll be fine. they'll probably just make you stand in the back."
phoebe,"okay, now. what?"
phoebe,"i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. i'm just a little nervous."
phoebe,"okay, that helps."
joey,"hey, you know what? don't worry, pheebs! it usually takes me three takes too! (off the director's look) alright, eight."
chandler,"no, no. but let me show you what i can do. ""bagels and donuts. round food for every mood."""
chandler,"oh, because his penis was too big. (he notices that david is not amused) oh, i'm sorry, that's the kind of thing i do. (pause) they broke up because mike didn't want to get married. hey, what if you just let phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?"
chandler,what?
chandler,i didn't mean now...
chandler,"well, you're welcome! glad i could help."
chandler,"david, i'm pretending to read here!!"
joey,yeah! how you doin'? yeah alright!
joey,"hey, hey! you said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?"
joey,you really should have been more clear about that!
ross,hey!
joey,hey!
ross,(excited) you're never going to guess who i just saw downstairs!
monica,yeah. hey that’s was nice to see you guys back off and let joey get the girl for once.
ross,ok. i will be home right after work. ok. bye emmaemmaema. i lovedadylove you. (ross kisses emma.)
monica,they would like me to talk to you about the baby-talk. (waving her finger)it’s not so good.
ross,hey listen. joey. about molly. i would really prefer if you didn’t go after her.
joey,why not?
ross,"because it’s took us months to find a good nanny. and i wouldn’t want anything to, you know, drive her away."
joey,"so, what? you think i’m just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (expression changed from confused to ‘enlightened’) yeah that sounds about right…"
ross,"come on. there are plenty of women out there, ok. just...just forget about her…ok? she’s off limits."
joey,"owww man…why you had to go and said that for? now that you told me i cant have her, makes me want her even more!"
joey,ok thanks.
joey,thanks. do you get a lot of guys in here?
joey,oh good...
joey,all right let's just do this.
joey,please i have an extremely high threshold...holly mother of god! my face! my face!! i'm all right! i'm all right!
chandler,hey it's the most eligible man in ny. how's the moving on going?
ross,not well. i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
chandler,"well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. you know i mean think about it. single white male, divorced three times,"
ross,that's funny...do you think you'll ever work again?
phoebe,"one, two, three!"
joey,"i won, hey!"
ross,"you know what, i'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! (rubs lamp, stops because it's very hot) ah!! that thing gets hot!!"
rachel,"you know, ross, just keep making your jokes. how are you gonna feel if we actually do win?"
ross,"uh, you're not gonna win."
rachel,"oh, i know, i know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! and then how you gonna feel? you know, we're gonna be all like ""oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape"" and you're gonna be all like ""oh, i can't guys, i'll meet you guys up there, i gotta gas up the hyundai"""
ross,"ok, i've heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that."
chandler,"i can see the headline now: ""lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm""."
ross,why would i eat my own arm?
chandler,"well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want."
monica,"you know what, ross? i'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you."
ross,why?
rachel,we are looking for our christmas presents from monica.
chandler,what? that's terrible!
phoebe,"no-no, we do it every year!"
chandler,"oh well, that, that makes it not terrible."
phoebe,"no, yeah, we never find them! she's always best at us, that wily... minx."
rachel,"don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to joey's and search, ok?"
chandler,"no not okay, you can't look for monica's presents!"
phoebe,"oh no, we have to!"
chandler,"no, you don't have to, and you can't because i, i live here too."
phoebe,"well then, you should look with us."
chandler,why?
rachel,"chandler, aren't you worried about what to get monica for christmas?"
chandler,"no, i have a great idea for a present for her."
monica,"well, no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me."
chandler,oh suddenly flowers are feminine?
phoebe,hey everybody! happy thanksgiving!
joey,"phoebs! [does a ""come here!"" action]"
phoebe,"hey what's going on, joe?"
joey,"listen, i...i...i... need a good lie."
phoebe,oh...ok..how about the whole man walking on the moon thing? y'know? you can.. you can see the strings people!
joey,no..nonono...i need a good lie to explain why i wasn't at the work thing today.
phoebe,"oo. honey, you stink at lying."
joey,wha? i do not!
phoebe,"oh really? let me ask you something. yesterday at the coffeehouse, i went to the bathroom, and when i came back, my muffin was gone. who took it?"
joey,"somebody opened the door...to the coffeehouse, and a, raccoon (emphasizes), came running in and went straight for your muffin i said ""hey! don't eat that! that's phoebe's!"" and he said...[pauses for a while...realizing how stupid it sounds] he said ""joey, you stink at lying"". what am i going to do?"
phoebe,"don't worry, don't worry. we'll come up with a good lie. i'll help you practice it."
joey,look i don't usually ask out women that i meet in coffeehouses
joey,(turns round) gesundheit
joey,"really, great, did i actually ask you?"
joey,"(turns round again) seriously gunther you should see someone about that cold, if it gets much worse you could die! (gunther looks scared)"
ross,so how'd the date go?
phoebe,well it was awful every time i thought about what you said i started crying.
ross,so he hasn't called?
phoebe,would you call this girl? (puts on a crying act) thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing
ross,now i feel terrible this is all my fault.
phoebe,"well you not what you should feel terrible about, this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?"
ross,we are a rare breed.
rachel,hi!
joey,hey!
rachel,"joey, i gotta tell ya, i've been thinking all day about that scene you did, i mean, you were amazing!"
joey,"oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!"
rachel,"god, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!"
joey,"ow, i'm just going over the script now! you wanna read lines with me?"
rachel,"me? oh, no, i am not an actress."
joey,"oh, all right, i can ask monica."
rachel,"oh screw her, that part is mine!"
joey,"right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here."
rachel,"okay. (pause).(acting) hello drake, i'm surprised to see you here."
rachel,(pause) kiss me.
phoebe,"(excited) no! it's a great time, come in...! wow, hi... oh my gosh! what are you doing here? are you back from minsk?"
phoebe,"who cares, it got you here."
phoebe,wow. where is your luggage? (david thinks for a while)
phoebe,"a-allright, well... i'll call the cab company."
phoebe,"thank you! god, no! you should see me when... oh actually, no, i look pretty good."
phoebe,no...
phoebe,i'm... i'm just... i'm the worst person ever. how can i not tell david that i'm seeing mike?
monica,maybe he didn't give you a chance.
monica,"(comes over) o-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?"
chandler,"(shrinks back) right. you know what? actually i just get off the plane, so i'm feeling kinda gross. maybe i should just take a shower."
monica,you don't need a shower.
chandler,"(still backs away) alright, the truth is, i soiled myself during some turbulences."
monica,what do i smell? (sniffs him) i smell smoke. huh--did you smoke?
chandler,"yes, but i just had one. two. two tiny cigarettes. okay, five. a pack. two pack...a...a carton. three big fat cartons in two days. (how many cigs are there in one pack and how many packs in one carton in the us?) but it's over, i made a decision, i'm not gonna smoke anymore."
monica,(gets a pack out of his jacket)
chandler,"but, those are for you."
ross,"alright, we'll just, uh, see when you get here. bye. (hangs up) huh, that was my mom, she's stuck in terrible traffic."
rachel,"okay, well that's now the third sign that i should not leave emma."
ross,"oh, what were the other two?"
rachel,"well, let's see. the first one is: i don't want to. and, you know, i'm not going."
monica,okay if mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
monica,"what are you, animals? it's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!"
phoebe,"i gotta call him. just to talk to him, there's no harm in that."
monica,"phoebe, that's how it starts. i don't need to eat the cake, i'll just smell the icing... why don't i just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. and next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. phoebe, honey, i know this is hard. look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. and if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. i know that's not what you want. (pause) give me your phone."
phoebe,here.
monica,and now your cell.
phoebe,"okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to monica)"
monica,this is your cellphone?
phoebe,yes.
monica,this is your current cellphone?
phoebe,"yes, it reminds me of a simpler time."
monica,"phoebe, where's your purse?"
joey,"probably, yeah... i mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to ross."
rachel,"yeah... yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight."
joey,"yeah, i think that'd be best... so, so i'm gonna... i'm gonna take off..."
rachel,(joey walks to the door) although...
joey,(turns around very fast) i like although!
rachel,"i mean, you know... ross and i haven't dated in like... six years..."
joey,six years? wow... it's almost as long as highschool...
rachel,"plus, you know, he is with charlie now."
joey,absolutely! he's not thinking about you.
rachel,no...
joey,i'm thinking about you...
rachel,yeah...
ross,"[lost for words] yeah, er… that’s okay. we’ll talk about something else."
ross,yeah.
ross,ah!
ross,"well, he and i would probably have a lot to talk about."
monica,hi! [surprised]
chandler,hey!
monica,welcome home.
chandler,"oh, well, look at you!"
monica,what do you think?
chandler,"well, it’s great, well, i’m just wearing the same thing underneath! look at you."
phoebe,oh please...these guys...we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns. (mike seems to gag a little...and laughs nervously. they begin to leave. phoebe bolts back)
phoebe,china patterns!!!!!
rachel,this is easy...can't do this! (moves away...and finds her sweater sleeve stuck to the drawer)
rachel,oh! wow! seriously i can't do this. (fiddles more)
chandler,hey joe!
joey,hey!
chandler,listen er..i need to ask you a favor but you can't tell monica anything about it.
joey,i thought you didn't have secrets from monica.
chandler,and that would have made the official party line. (joey nods) monica and i are having a little financial trouble.
joey,yeah..i know.
chandler,what? what do you mean you know?
chandler,see? intuitive!
chandler,which technically now you should give back!
chandler,"i'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. ""owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that santa is real."""
ross,everyone? i would like to make a toast to rachel and joey.
rachel,ooy.
ross,"and to love. ah, love. l-o-v-e, love. l is for life. and what is life without love?"
rachel,"oh my god, are we supposed to answer?"
ross,"o is for ""oh, wow!"" the v is for this very surprising turn of events, which i'm still fine with by the way. e is for how extremely normal i find it. that you two are together. and now one day you might get married and have children of your own."
ross,"oh... ok, fine. but... ehm... i just have one question for you, ehm... (aping professor spafford) when we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll..."
ross,"(entering with charlie) oh, hey you guys! this is charlie! charlie, this is phoebe and my sister, monica."
phoebe,hi!
ross,"yeah, charlie is gonna be joining my department."
phoebe,"oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) oh, ok, now, what do you think of ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?"
phoebe,"ah, ah."
ross,(to phoebe) ranion's theory of species variegation?
phoebe,"yeah, i saw the article on your coffee table and i memorized the title to freak you out!"
monica,"(to ross) so, did you two have fun?"
ross,"oh my god, she's great! i mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny..."
monica,and i don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud) hotty!! (charlie looks at her) hi!
rachel,"(she enters wearing a bath-robe) hey... hi you guys! listen, you know what? i'm not feeling really well. i think i can't get out for the play."
chandler,"you guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! you're both polite! (pause) go to have a seat zack, and i'll get you a beer."
monica,i got it.
chandler,"(to mon) so, zack's pretty nice, uh?"
monica,"yeah, i guess."
chandler,"so, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!"
monica,(turns around and she's quite shocked) excuse me?
chandler,"well, we're talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy! i mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, i mean, he is ""spermtastic""!"
monica,"chandler, this is crazy! what did you even say to him! ""come up, meet my wife! give us your sperm""!"
chandler,"no, i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! i mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out."
monica,chandler!
chandler,"i'm telling you, he's great! i mean, even if my sperm worked fine, i'd think he'd be the way to go!"
monica,i'm not going to be a part of this! you can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
chandler,ok!
monica,uh!
chandler,"oh, come on!"
monica,"hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!"
chandler,why are you here?
chandler,"(to heaven) no no no... i mean, why? why is she here??"
chandler,what!?
monica,this was fun! but i've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! (leaves)
chandler,"i'd love to stay, but i have eh... (points at the cup) got a hot date... (starts to leave)"
chandler,(disgusted) i think it just fell off. (leaves)
phoebe,"(in a strange heavy accent) hello ""ja"", it's time for your massage, ja! put your face in the hole."
phoebe,"yeah, you are. and i'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because i don't know what i would do without you."
monica,i won't know what i would do without you.
monica,"well, i guess we should go back in. when you gave me another chance, i guess we should do the same for amanda."
phoebe,"yeah, i guess you're right."
ross,"i'm gonna stop you right there, glenda. okay? does it look like this is my first time, huh? now i want 4 two's... and i want them all on my back."
ross,"wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?"
ross,which... which... which... which one is it?
ross,oh! son of a bitch!
rachel,what is the matter with us?
chandler,really? that's great!
chandler,"it's funny. when you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid."""
chandler,"actually, we're trying, and i don't think monica's gonna wanna postpone it. we're supposed to have sex tonight. actually, she's probably at home naked right now. i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. i can just picture her on the bed right now."
rachel,"wait a minute! what do you mean, you're taking over my job?"
rachel,a vacation? my idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
rachel,"alright! don't get too comfortable there, because i'm back in two weeks! and i want everything back to the way it was. i can't say that i care too much for the way you've rearranged my office."
rachel,excuse me?
ross,rach we have a code brown situation.
joey,oh! ah! eh... britney spears!?
ross,"yeah, she never misses these conferences! (then to charlie) no, i just saw dr. kenneth schwartz!"
ross,yeah... what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz?
joey,"you could say: ""hey kenny, how come you're not britney spears?"" (looks at ross matter-of-factly)"
ross,(to charlie) ready to go?
joey,wha...? you're gonna go now? i thought we could hang out?
ross,yeah.
joey,(smiling) will you wear a thong?
joey,oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
ross,"(a little embarassed by their conversation) i'm good, i have dinner plans (moves away from them)."
joey,"yeah, yeah. i've got tons of stuff i could do. i'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming..."
ross,what are you a child?
joey,yesss!
ross,"look. joey, come on. now, for me. please, just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else."
joey,alright.
monica,take me home!
phoebe,hey mikey.
phoebe,what are you doing?
phoebe,to kill bob?
phoebe,": but no, mike, i don’t want to kill him. i thought we were just gonna capture him and, you know set him free in the countryside, where you can may be meet, you know, a friendly possum and a wise cracking owl."
chandler,what are doing? you know i can only dish it out!
ross,i can't believe rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me
chandler,"maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing"
ross,"no no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar."
chandler,did she go out with him?
ross,"no. when he called, i...i threw the message away."
chandler,ah! the high road...
ross,you know what? enough! enough talking! i have to get moving! hey check out those two blondes over there!
chandler,are you trying to get everybody divorced?
ross,"you don't have to do anything. it will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? you...you break the"
chandler,i thought i had to make the jokes!
ross,don't you have to be at work?
monica,"because i know that you think the lottery is ""boohaki"" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. and you're my brother, and i want you to be a part of this."
ross,"you don't have to do that, i'll pay for myself. but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! come here (they kiss and hug)"
phoebe,get a room!
chandler,"ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?"
ross,"i don't know, probably just invest it."
chandler,ooh! calm down ...
joey,"seriously, that's your fantasy? to invest it?"
ross,"oh, i'm sorry, did i say ""invest it""? i meant ""be cool and piss it all away"" (joey and chandler pleased)"
joey,"ooh, ooh, i know! we should pool all own money and buy the knicks!"
rachel,i don't really care about the knicks.
phoebe,"oh, that's it? (mimics chandler) a great idea! oh yeah."
rachel,"chandler, that's not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? and you've just gotten her one great present? i mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. why would you do that to her chandler? why? why?"
chandler,"if i help, we can find 'em faster!"
rachel,that's right!
phoebe,"ooh ooh, we have a live one!"
rachel,"oh, it's a macy's bag!"
rachel,oh.
phoebe,"ooh, who's it for?"
rachel,"(reading from a tag that's attached to the shoe) ""dear losers, do you really think i'd hide presents under the couch? p.s.: chandler, i knew they'd break you."""
joey,"rach, these are for you."
joey,oh that'd be great. that'd be great. thank you.
phoebe,sure. what was the work thing?
phoebe,pick up grandma at the airport?
joey,ohhh man! [covers his eyes and bends down]
rachel,oh she's precious...
rachel,"amy...yes i do, i really do. [reaches out toward ross and he grabs her hand]"
ross,sure! we don't live there but...
rachel,"yeah, no ross has a phd."
rachel,god! she is...unbelievable!
ross,i know! i mean a phd is just as good as an md.
rachel,"yeah, oh sure ross yeah! if i have a heart attack at a restaurant, i want you there with your fossil brush!"
joey,yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that last piece of cake at the restaurant.
joey,do you have any cake?
joey,(bends down to see and the cactus pricks him in the ass) awch! that's why.
ross,"(he knocks at the door, mike opens it) hey mike sorry to just drop by like this, can i come in?"
ross,"i'm ross, phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse."
ross,"yeah i really, really need to talk to you about something."
ross,(laughs) no
ross,damn super cuts!
joey,what?
rachel,kiss me.
joey,"ah, rach, it doesn't say that!"
rachel,"no, i'm saying..."
joey,"but, but.."
rachel,just... don't talk... (she kisses him)
rachel,"(waking up) ehhh, aw! (pause). well, that's new!"
ross,"(on the phone) hi, this is ross geller in suite 206. it seems you forgot a couple of things. could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) thank you! ok. toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and i feel like i am forgetting something... is there anything else you have that i haven't asked for already? (pause) yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons."
ross,what did you get?
chandler,usa today
ross,"nice, put it with the others."
chandler,and i also got... two more apples.
ross,"we are four short of a bush-o (pause). god i feel so alive, i love being in the country!"
phoebe,he said: are you seeing someone? and i said no...
monica,"oh, well... that had been your window."
phoebe,"yeah! i mean, i don't know. i was just , i was looking, i was looking in his eyes and i was just thinking: oh my god! it's david. david's here. he's just, he's so irresistible."
monica,really? the scientist guy?
phoebe,really? chandler?
monica,continue...
phoebe,"oh.okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then i told him that i would see him tomorrow night."
monica,phoebe!
phoebe,"i know! (points at herself) evil! and... and... and... i like mike so much, you know. it's just going really well. oh my god!"
monica,"wow, isn't it ironic that david would show up on the same day that you and mike exchange keys?"
phoebe,"(sarcastically) uhuh... yeah...!, you know. and given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy i am."
monica,what are you gonna do?
ross,"i know, it's the first time, we're leaving the baby and ... hey, i know how hard it is for you, but ... but emma is gonna be fine. my mom is gonna be with her. she's great with kids."
rachel,she is?
ross,ya.
rachel,what about (?) monica.
ross,"hey, you only heard monica's side of that. that little fatso was a terror."
rachel,ish. i just don't think i can bear it.
ross,"rachel, i know that you can. and you should."
rachel,uch.
ross,"really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you, why don't you go ahead to the restaurant and i will wait for my mom and then i'll meet you there."
rachel,oh-a.
ross,"no, no, really. you should go. just go! go! go out! really, the world is your oyster. kick up the heels. paint the town red. (slang right?)"
rachel,you need to learn some new slang.
monica,"no, no! give it to me!"
phoebe,you can't have it.
monica,give it to me!
phoebe,no (tucks it in her pants)
monica,i'll go in there.
phoebe,(disbelievingly) oh yeah.
monica,phoebe come here
monica,haha!
phoebe,damn you monica geller hyphen bing!
joey,"hey, look who's here! it's joey, and he brought home a friend."
rachel,"joey, emma's right here! you promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore."
joey,"no, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new hugsy!"
joey,let's forget about ross...
rachel,forgotten.
joey,what's wrong?
rachel,nothing...
rachel,"nothing... it's really... it's nothing... come here, come here..."
rachel,"sorry, i just uhm... i can't seem to get ross out of my head..."
joey,"well, maybe i can help. (he grabs her head passionately, closes his eyes and kisses... ross in rachel's dress! he realises it too late, and when he does, pushes ross's/rachel's head away)"
joey,yeah... we really need to talk to ross...
ross,hey!
chandler,hey!
ross,you guys ready to go?
joey,"ooh. hey, how come you door’s locked?"
monica,just a second.
chandler,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. joey can’t know that i am here."
monica,why not?
chandler,"because i didn’t know how to tell him that i couldn’t go to the knicks game, so i just told him that i had to stay in tulsa."
monica,so you lied to him?
chandler,"eh, it is always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion. [monica glares at him] except with you!"
joey,hey! open the door! what’s going on?
monica,hi!
joey,why are you dressed like that?
monica,"[nervous giggle] because i, erm, well, chandler’s gonna be home in a couple of days, so i thought that i would just, er, practice the art of seduction."
joey,er....i just figured it out! you know..i mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
chandler,oh! right.
chandler,"anyway, er... i need to borrow some money."
joey,oh! sure! how much? two thousand dollars?
chandler,yes! two thousand dollars exactly! how do you know that! (joey begins writing a cheque)
joey,er....well i...know how much you used to make...and i know how much your rent is. (shrugs)
chandler,oh ok.
joey,er...kind of..
chandler,i can't believe her! did she tell you we were having money problems?
joey,oh no no no no no...it wasn't...it wasn't because of your money problems...it was for something...for her.
chandler,what?
joey,"dude, are you okay?"
ross,totally.
rachel,"ross, you don't seem okay."
ross,no!
ross,wasn't it? and you thought it would be awkward with joey and that you never really liked rachel.
ross,okay.
rachel,"oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me."
ross,"okay, i guess it's just flan for three! hey, hey, that rhymed!"
rachel,"you know what, ross? i think we're gonna take off too."
ross,"oh, oh. of course. god, i'm so stupid. you guys are a couple now. i mean, you probably just want to be alone."
rachel,"no, no, it's just that it's getting late..."
ross,really? wh-what's wrong?
rachel,"i don't know! i think it's kind of serious! oh, you know... i was watching this thing on tv this morning about... newcastle disease... and i think i might have it!!"
rachel,"... ok, who is this?"
ross,"i'm sorry, rachel, this is charlie wealer, she's a collegue."
rachel,"oh, hi! i would check your hand but... i'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!"
monica,"hey, rachel, can-can i see you for a sec?"
rachel,sure! (monica takes her apart) oh...
monica,you're not sick!
rachel,"what? yes, i am!"
monica,"ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??"
rachel,"when you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe)"
monica,you just wanna stay home so you can make a move on joey!
chandler,(bringing the beer to zack) zack!
monica,"tell me about yourself, zack!"
rachel,"oh, god, do you think she heard? it would be so bad if she heard!"
phoebe,"well, maybe she didn't hear! ok i'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and i'll talk and see if you can hear me."
rachel,"ok, great!"
rachel,"oh, thank god i can't hear a word that you're saying!"
phoebe,(sticks her head out) i didn't say anything yet!
rachel,"(sticks her head out too) well, get back in there and talk!"
phoebe,(goes back in) i'm rachel. it's so annoying when i put emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
rachel,(comes out again) what!?
phoebe,"(comes out too) well, some things are just hard to say to your face."
rachel,"ok well, i heard that! which means that she heard it too!"
phoebe,ooh! we have a problem.
rachel,"wow, a swedish massage from a real swedish person. (puts her head in the hole and phoebe enters)"
phoebe,"okay, then i'm swedish..."
monica,"so, what's your name?"
phoebe,it's a normal swedish name... ikea...
rachel,oh... what an interesting name.
phoebe,ja!
rachel,you know i... (lifts her head and tries to look in phoebe's direction)
phoebe,(pushes her head back down) time for your scalp massage!
rachel,(sees phoebe's slippers through the hole) wow... i really love your... (startled as she realizes those are phoebe's slippers)
phoebe,is something wrong?
rachel,"no, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... ikea... (pause) yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of sweden?"
phoebe,(thinks for a few moments) uhm... stockholm.
joey,"well, i know what's the matter with me."
rachel,"no, i mean with us, you know. i mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?"
joey,i don't know.
chandler,"that fake british woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... hey!"
rachel,"hi! hey, listen, can we ask you a question? when you and monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?"
chandler,"kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys..."
rachel,"no, no, no... no, i mean... se-x-u-ally..."
joey,"yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?"
chandler,"actually, no. no, it felt right. you know, it felt like uhm... i can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time."
chandler,"i can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... well, i'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(chandler leaves the apartment. joey sighs)"
rachel,"can you please, please take care of it for me?"
ross,"alright, but you have to do one sometime."
rachel,let me just get this straight! so i go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
rachel,that's right. you're very cheeky for a temp.
rachel,"oh yeah, what department was that? the jerk department?"
rachel,did they mention that i'm rubber and you're glue?
rachel,"oh, hi mr. zelner."
rachel,"that's great. so now, super gavin, when i come back where are you planning on flying off to?"
rachel,"(to herself) oh, wow. super ass-kissing power."
rachel,today.
rachel,"no, i said today! see, for a superhero, not so much with the listening."
joey,hey.
ross,"uh, joe, have you looked outside?"
joey,"no, why?"
joey,oh man!
joey,"i wasn't gonna swim, i was gonna dig a hole! (removes a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his backpack)"
monica,wow! that mike thing was interesting! i don't know what's gonna happen with phoebe and david.
chandler,"(smiling cheekily) i do! want a hint? huh? ""i do"" (monica looks confused, so chandler repeats) ""i do""."
monica,"ok, i'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee."
chandler,david is going to propose to phoebe.
monica,what? (looks very shocked) why?
chandler,"be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married."
monica,"chandler, we have talked about this. you are not supposed to give people advice! now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?"
chandler,"i did! a penis one! look, just so i know, what was so wrong about what i said?"
phoebe,"ok, i will find bob. i will get him. (calling for bob) bob! bob robert!)"
phoebe,oh wait. i think i hear him.
phoebe,oh my god…bob had babies…bob is a mom.
phoebe,oh i don’t know. i kinda like bob for a girl.
phoebe,"oh my god, you killed bob?"
phoebe,(she calls out loudly)suzie? (she got up to see what it is.)
ross,whaaat’sss uupppp?
chandler,"(standing up) seriously dude, three years ago."
ross,"listen, can you do me a favour? i’m gonna be out today. can you just keep an eye on joey? make sure nothing happens between him and molly?"
chandler,you don’t trust him?
chandler,"oh come on! hello! hi! my name is chandler, here's my friend ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it."
ross,"hum...so...hum...oh hey i noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in europe? here’s a question: ""would you..."
chandler,we still got it!
rachel,who is it?
rachel,why?
rachel,"oh! right! yeah! hold on, i'll be just clean up in here a little bit! hello gavin"
rachel,"i a not gonna lie to you, i'm pretty sick"
rachel,oh no no no
joey,"oh, you will when i pick you as starting forward."
rachel,(touched) you would do that? i never get picked!
chandler,"you know, i'm not sure a sports team is the way to go."
joey,you're not gonna let me buy the knicks?? i can't believe you're taking this away from me!
chandler,"you're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds."
ross,"(to rachel) uh, how long until they announce the numbers, mommy?"
chandler,(looks around) i'll take this one too (to ross) uh ... mommy?
ross,"oh, i've gotten into the habit of calling rachel ""mommy"" when we're around emma. which i now realize we are not ..."
rachel,i'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
ross,"although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me ""daddy"" too."
rachel,wiper blades. i don't even have a car.
joey,"no, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."
chandler,"ok, pheebs, your turn."
phoebe,"ahh, toilet seat covers! is that what you were doing while i was getting gas?"
joey,uh-huh.
phoebe,you guuuyys.
joey,"and for ross, mr. sweet-tooth."
ross,you got me a cola drink?
chandler,"and, a lemon lime."
ross,"well this, this is too much, i feel like i should get you another sweater."
chandler,and last but not least.
joey,they're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
rachel,what? what? what happened?
ross,don't say that!
rachel,oh amy...don't cry. erm. ross? could i talk to you in private?
ross,sure you wanna go upstairs? or...
rachel,"erm look. i was thinking, if it's ok with monica, i would like to invite amy, to thanksgiving."
ross,you know i think that's a great idea. it'll be like the pilgrims being in the indian's syphillis.
rachel,"look, i know she's a little tough to take...but she has no where else to go. and she's my sister. alright? and she's emma's aunt? and i'd like them to bond..."
ross,ok...fine. but i don't want them bonding too much. i don't want her telling emma she needs a nose job.
ross,"oh no yeah, no phoebe is great, but umm i'm an idiot look right before you guys went out i accidentally got her all upset."
ross,"yes, yeah i said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please don't blow her off."
ross,well then i didn't need to bother you or the four other mike hanagens i bothered.
ross,of course she has… if she'd never had a serious relationship i'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
ross,"yes, yes i did… and i will also say what i'm about to say vis-à-vis the following phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her… super-serious relationship with… vicrum."
ross,what that's a real name!
chandler,"(enters singing) oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plane, stop it! why couldn't they have sent me to texas? 7 o clock maybe i'll hit the gym (sits down) who am i kidding pay-per-view porn."
chandler,do not disturb do not disturb! monica (smiles)
chandler,i also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
ross,"oh, that's not cool."
ross,"no, chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. for example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. (pause) now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) i wish i'd thought this through."
chandler,"i think i know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that."
ross,"not my first time in a hotel, my friend."
chandler,"ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?"
ross,"no, no, no, you can't take the remote control!"
chandler,"yes, but the batteries..."
chandler,"thank you, thank you very much!"
ross,let's celebrate with some maple candy!
chandler,no!
phoebe,"i mean i guess, i just have to... tell david that nothing can happen between us. unless i don't... you know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong..."
monica,you have to tell david!
phoebe,"okay, i knew i should have had this conversation with joey."
chandler,"(angry) funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) i'm funny, right...? what do you know, you're a door... you just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) save it for inside! (he enters)"
monica,heeeeeey!
chandler,hey!
phoebe,hey!
chandler,"so... oklahoma is a crazy place. you know, they call it the sooner state. frankly i'd sooner be in any other state. (monica looks at phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) and what's with oklahoma having a pan handle? can all states have stuff like that? hey yeah, i'm from the waistband, wyoming. but when i was seven, we headed over to the crotch."
monica,(doesn't believe what she's hearing) was your cabin pressurised?
chandler,"(laughs, but then moves to phoebe) and don't get me started on the way that people from tulsa talk."
ross,"i'm serious. c'mon, you should go. here. (shoves her outside, while she tries to stay) no, uh-uh, just go."
rachel,what ... oh! (points inside)
ross,"no! no, you know what? (closes the door) you [can't get in there] (?), the baby's fine, now squam (?). yeah, [i told you a|tell your] story walking. (?)"
rachel,i was just going to say that i left my keys.
ross,"oh, (door is locked) holy moly are we in a pickle now."
phoebe,where is everyone? they're forty minutes late.
joey,"i know, u-uch."
phoebe,"i'm starving. i know we were coming here tonight, i ate nothing all day."
joey,"what about me, he? only had one lunch today."
phoebe,"yes, they are expected presently. yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing."
joey,"no, they're comin', we're waitin' right here."
rachel,"oh that's so great, now emma has two hugsy's."
joey,"no, no, emma has one hugsy, the new hugsy, huh? the other hugsy, i don't know, i guess i'll just take it back."
rachel,"oh you know what? when i was a little girl i had a little pink pony named cotton. oh i loved her so much, i took her everywhere, i would braid her tail..."
joey,make the transfer! (she does so)
rachel,should i be concerned that a button fell off the old hugsy and i can't find it?
joey,"oh, no don't worry about that, i swallowed that years ago."
rachel,"oh, i don't think she likes the new hugsy."
joey,but he's the same.
rachel,"yeah, i think she wants the old one back."
joey,but he's the same.
rachel,"joey, come on!"
chandler,"not quite. monica's still at the salon, and i'm just finishing packing."
ross,dude! you're not taking your bible?
chandler,"you're not supposed to take that. besides, it's a new testament, what are you gonna do with it?"
ross,learn about jesus...
ross,hey!
ross,"uh, no... no. i couldn't find him. i'm just gonna talk to him on the plane."
ross,stop it!
ross,you're filthy!
phoebe,"hey, have you guys seen monica?"
ross,"uh, actually i think she went to the salon."
joey,i thought i heard a man’s voice before?
monica,"i was just doing chandler’s side of the conversation, y’know like “hi”, “how do i look” [in chandler’s voice] “really sexy”, “could i be any more turned on?”"
joey,"woah, woah, woah. why are there two glasses of wine out?"
monica,"because, one of them is for you! [monica goes to get a glass. chandler looks at joey through the peep-hole and chandler ducks. monica comes back to the door with the two glasses of red wine. gives one to joey. ‘clinks’ the glasses together] okay, bye, bye!"
chandler,"you know, it’s funny. i’ve been practising the art of seduction as well! hya! [does a wiggle]"
monica,you might wanna keep practising.
chandler,yeah. [chandler’s phone goes off] it’s joey.
monica,what?
chandler,"hey, joe!"
joey,"dude, come home!"
chandler,what? why?
joey,something personal.
chandler,what would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
joey,boob job.
monica,i don't want her to get a boob job! that's crazy!
joey,well it's...it's not that crazy. ok? making them smaller. that would be crazy.
phoebe,oh! alright. well i think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomie.
phoebe,oh no! no no! not at all. we're just moving in right now. see where it goes.
phoebe,what do you mean?
ross,"hey, hey, it's fine. it's totally fine. we've got plenty of margaritas. it's all good."
ross,i don't even know what that's for.
joey,you know what? i think i'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
rachel,"yeah, that's probably a good idea."
joey,yeah. i'll see you in the morning.
rachel,"uh-huh. okay. you know what, joey, i don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this."
joey,"it doesn't look good, does it?"
joey,morning. here you go.
ross,thanks. did you stay here all night?
joey,yeah.
rachel,"oh, no, no! i heard you before, that is so not what this is!"
monica,"ok, what is this?"
rachel,ok! (whispering) joey is having a secret days of our lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
monica,(aloud) what?
ross,(looking at them) wh-what's going on?
monica,joey is having a secret days of our lives party up on the roof!
rachel,and he didn't want you guys to know about it but i came over here to tell you!!
rachel,ok professor or detective?
phoebe,joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
rachel,"yeah, and he does it every year! that's why he's sending you to that play! that's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!"
phoebe,and that horrible museum tour!
ross,"no, i arranged that..."
rachel,oh! what are we gonna do?
rachel,oh my god!
rachel,(yelling at the stranger) alright! enough out of you!
joey,hello?
ross,"joey! hey, i need to talk to charlie. is she there?"
joey,no. no... eh... she went shopping with rachel. why? what's up?
ross,i'm meeting with professor sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
joey,oh! how's it going?
ross,"it could be better! he, uhm... he fell asleep!"
joey,what!? but i already bought my ticket to bermuda!
rachel,damn! i wish i knew if that was right!
joey,(gesturing at an imaginary painting) note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
ross,"now, do you have any idea what you just said?"
joey,"(shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) no, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!"
ross,"ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, monet is not spelt m-o-n-a-y. i just... i wrote that out phonetically for you."
joey,phonetically? (looks confused)
ross,"yeah, yeah that means... you know? we just... we don't have time for this."
joey,ok.
ross,"ok, but you know what? i gotta say, i'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!"
joey,"ah! i'm an actor! i can memorize anything! last week on ""days"" i had to say ""frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy""."
ross,wow. what does that mean?
rachel,"well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us."
joey,"yeah, yeah... absolutely. i mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit."
rachel,"right, totally."
joey,"yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it."
rachel,"yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex."
joey,that's a... pla-an.
joey,(sighs) wow... i did not see this coming.
rachel,i know.
joey,"i don't get it. i mean, i was so sure this was what i wanted."
rachel,hmmm... me too...
rachel,i wonder how monica and chandler could do it?
joey,i guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
phoebe,"hey. so, what did he say?"
joey,"well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so i'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word ""puppy."" okay, so he said: ""if your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, i'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass."""
phoebe,"i'm sorry, i can't do this. i'm not an actor."
joey,"that's right, you're not. you're a nurse. you're nurse with tray."
phoebe,joey.
joey,"no, no. nurse with tray doesn't know joey, she doesn't have time for friends. she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!"
phoebe,who dies?
joey,(points to man on operating table) man with eye patch! you get in there and you do your job.
phoebe,"yes, doctor."
joey,okay.
phoebe,"hang in there, man with eye patch, your tray is coming!"
monica,"they've only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike! she'll say ""no"", david's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again."
chandler,"man, that's some bad advice!"
joey,oh! hey! thank god you guys are here!
rachel,hey! hey what's going on?
joey,"everything is upside down here! it rains all day long, nobody watches tv and ross is famous!"
rachel,"alright, i don't wanna alarm anybody, but monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!"
monica,"ok! when i go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!"
chandler,that's why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross!
joey,"come on, i'll show you guys where to check in (joey, chandler and david leave)"
monica,"(to chandler) oh, honey, can you make sure we get a king size bed!"
phoebe,"(shouts after david) oh! david, get one for us too! oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! and with mirrors on the ceiling!"
ross,"what? no. some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, err… the hot nanny."
chandler,is this really your long term plan for me to run interference? because i can get a job any day now. (he sit down and put his legs on the table.)
ross,"you do appear right on the *** something . oh come one. i’m sure he will lose interest in a week or two. but for now, can you please just do this for me?"
chandler,"alright, fine. but don’t blame me if it doesn’t work cause you know as well as i do, once joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he’s going to have sex with it."
ross,"well, well i mean we got to do something, ok? nanny's like her doesn’t grow on trees."
chandler,picturing that tree?
ross,oh yeah.
chandler,where are you going joe?
joey,for a walk.
rachel,so did i
rachel,it's just a cold
rachel,what? what's the matter?
rachel,oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. he thought it would be funny.
rachel,"oh you're not. you're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about ross really, really."
rachel,i lied! and i'm not sick! just stay behind the curtain!
rachel,oh! molly! you're not ross.
rachel,"right, right, yes!"
phoebe,"oooh, i like that, ""daddy"" (in a sexy tone)"
ross,i ... i was just talking about rachel.
phoebe,"(still in sexy tone) oooh, is daddy getting angry? is daddy gonna spank me?"
ross,(tries to be sexy too) well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. (stops) no i can't.
chandler,"hello? hello? oh, hey charlie. did anybody else hear? ... what? susan got it?? how? oh man, i would have slept with him!! .. alright, bye. (hangs up)"
joey,"dude, i'm sorry. but hey, there's one spot left, right?"
chandler,"well no, charlie's gonna get that."
monica,"hey, don't say that! you got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!"
chandler,he's the boss's son.
monica,"come on, lottery!! (everybody cheers)"
rachel,"ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes."
monica,"ok, here we go. we need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. so does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? (doesn't let them answer) ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first."
ross,"ooh, hey ben, what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?"
ross,yeah!
monica,come on ben.
ross,years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees...
chandler,"(entering in a santa costume) ho, ho, ho! merry christmas!"
chandler,hey! (grunts as ben hits him at full speed.)
ross,"what are you doing here, santa?"
chandler,"well, i'm here to see my old buddy ben. what are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?"
ross,"i'm the holiday armadillo, your part-jewish friend. you sent me here to give ben some presents. remember?"
chandler,what?
rachel,"well! ross, you know what? she may need one we're just going to have to make our peace with that."
rachel,hi!!
rachel,"hey you guys! this is my sister amy...this is chandler, joey, phoebe and you know mon!"
joey,yeah!
monica,hi. [they exchange pecks on the cheek]
joey,phoebs! i still need some help here.
phoebe,"oh! right ok. erm...ok..so it's not just the lie you tell, but it's the way you tell it for example, if you look down on the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying."
monica,is everything all right?
chandler,"everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise. (she hugs him, and she knows what he was doing so she looks at the tv and sees sharks swimming around thinking chandler was giving himself a treat to sharks.)"
monica,i'm gonna go freshen up ok
chandler,ok honey… that was close.
rachel,hello
monica,hey rach its me ok i just got the chandler's room and i caught him molesting himself.
rachel,oh that couldn't have been pretty… but you know guys do that.
monica,yea well the weird part is... he was getting off to a shark attack show!
rachel,nooooooooo!
monica,yes! chandler watches shark porn!
rachel,well watching sharks? are you sure that's what he was doing?
ross,at least tell me where you hid it.
rachel,can i ask you a question?
monica,yeah.
rachel,have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
monica,"let me think. oh, when i was younger i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese, and on our wedding night i ate his head."
rachel,"ok, well this is like that...in no way. i had a...i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey."
monica,"wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?"
rachel,"oh yeah! i mean, that was pretty intense."
monica,what do you think brought than on?
rachel,"i don't know! i mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday."
phoebe,okay. (and she walks away)
chandler,"what's with the word y'all? you know, just... two words just... pushed together... are we all allowed to do that, because if so, i say why stop there? you know, your new poodle could be your noodle. and fried chicken? could be fricken.waiter, waiter excuse me, i'll have the fricken? (monica laughs) see, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?"
monica,"no, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. i told you about that funny guy, geoffrey, right?"
chandler,"yeah, he came up..."
monica,"well, he did this bit... you probably had to be there, but it was liza minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (phoebe bursts out in a laugh)"
chandler,(to phoebe) were you there?
phoebe,"no, but it sounds like it was fricken funny..."
rachel,"sandy, that's exactly what it is..."
phoebe,"joseph! (to waiter) thou needn't worry, they shan't be long."
phoebe,one really does have a stick up one's ass. doesn't one?
monica,"how can you smoke in this day of age? do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling."
joey,he's the same!
joey,(to the new hugsy) you're not the same!
monica,haha!
phoebe,"you know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after i've buzzed you into the building."
monica,"so phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door."
phoebe,those are my shoes.
monica,"oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping."
phoebe,"monica, i really appreciate you checking in on me, but i'm actually feeling a lot better. yeah, i just kinda want to be alone right now."
monica,who's that? (goes to open door)
phoebe,i ordered chinese food.
phoebe,"oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright..."
monica,check it out!
phoebe,who's day just got better? chandler!
chandler,hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
monica,what do you think?
chandler,i think.... i think i can see your scalp.
monica,don't you just love it?
ross,ye... yeah... yeah... you got shellfish in your head.
ross,"you've never said that in your life, have you?"
ross,i thought so.
monica,and listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells tingle)
joey,come home!
chandler,"look, i can’t. what’s going on?"
joey,"i don’t know how to tell you this, but i think that monica’s cheating on ya! i told you that you shouldn’t have married someone much hotter than you! chandler looks at monica. they nod then put their ears back to the phone. joey walks out of his apartment and up to monica’s door] right, look. if you can’t come home and deal with this, then i'm gonna…"
chandler,[loudly] no!
joey,i just heard him!
chandler,[quiet] can you hear him now?
joey,"no. right, i’m going in!"
chandler,[loudly] no! wait!
joey,i heard him again!
chandler,right. just stay there. i'm coming home.
joey,great. i’ll see you when you get here. i’m gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.
chandler,is that really necessary?
phoebe,oh. wow.
phoebe,was it really that bad?
phoebe,ok..well that's bad...but don't you think it might be different with someone else? perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. except for once in the ocean.
phoebe,but it's just..
phoebe,oh!
phoebe,no! i definitely don't wanna get married. no i just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. whew! coz you know when we move in...and you start changing your mind..there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
phoebe,yeah i get that.
rachel,hi!
monica,so you gave in and decided to call someone?
ross,so you took off my pants and shoes?
joey,"no, no, no. you actually did that when you were dancing to the chicago-soundtrack. look, ross, about, about rachel and i. listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? because nothing is gonna happen."
ross,what do you mean?
joey,"well, she and i said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. and clearly.."
ross,"hey, what are you talking about? i'm fine!"
joey,"it's okay, ross, alright? i totally understand. of course you're not fine. you're.. you're ross and rachel."
ross,"except we're not. i mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. oh my god, is that right? has it been that long?"
joey,"that's what i hear, yeah."
ross,"this is crazy. i mean, six years? and because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? can i ask you something? really, what is this thing with you and rachel?"
joey,"come on, i mean, you know me, you know..."
ross,joey.
joey,i'm crazy about her.
joey,"(sounds tired) hey you guys, i'm turning in. have fun."
phoebe,we know about your party joey.
joey,what party?
monica,the game's over! take off your robe!
joey,(looks perplexed and opens up his robe) ok... i mean...
joey,(to charlie after covering himself up again) nice to meet ya! (charlie waves hesitantly and joey leaves)
joey,"(to some people) hey! hey alright! hey, glad you could make it (shakes a man's hand) thanks for coming."
monica,oh my god! kyle lowder!
monica,(yells after him) i love you!
joey,"hey, that's why i didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something..."
monica,oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
ross,barbados.
joey,"fine, i'll rent a car and drive...! ross, you have to get that job!"
ross,what am i supposed to do? he's out cold! in fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named fran to spank him harder.
joey,"well, just wake him up!"
ross,"i can't! if he realizes that i'm the one that put him to sleep, i won't get the job!"
joey,"uh! that's a tough one. oh! wait a minute, this happened to me before! yeah, i was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... yeah i mean hey, shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?"
monica,hey guys! dinner's ready!
chandler,"so what do you think? i want that guys genes for my kid! those eyes, those cheeckbones!"
monica,"ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!"
chandler,you don't like him.
monica,i think he is fine! it's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
chandler,alright! just follow my lead!
chandler,"oh! thanks, i'm crazy about our place. hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?"
joey,"no idea! but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear""."
ross,ok! so let's move on to the renaissance?
joey,"ok, caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. touch it, it's really bumpy! (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting)."
ross,"nah ah! nah ah! (stops him form doing so) no no no! no ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings."
joey,come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)
ross,no! (slaps his hand)
chandler,(to the nurse at the nurses' station) my specimen is in the room and i just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while i was in there. really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees janice is still there) janice! you're not... gone?
chandler,yeah! yeah... the hard part is over!
chandler,i haven't... i haven't even thought about the results yet... i just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
chandler,"(slightly panicky) yeah, but what if it's not? what if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?"
rachel,aah... i bet you're right.
joey,so...
rachel,yeah.
joey,i love ya.
rachel,"love you too... alright, i'm going to bed."
joey,"yeah, me too."
joey,"ooh, yeah, i'm not going anywhere for a while."
chandler,"dude, it's chandler. let me in."
ross,go away! i don't want to see anybody.
phoebe,"(does the scene) yes, i did it!!! i nailed it!!! yay! what's next?"
phoebe,"okay, from the top, people!"
rachel,"listen. sudden change of plans. my maternity leave just ended. they told me that if i didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me."
ross,"what? no, that's illegal. i'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even..."
rachel,"alright, alright. calm down norma rae. they didn't actually say that. i'm just afraid if i don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out."
ross,what about emma? we don't have a nanny.
rachel,"i know. you know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. can you please just take care of her for today?"
ross,absolutely. just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
rachel,"come on, i don't know what else to do."
ross,"fine, fine. (to emma) we'll have fun, won't we? yes, we will, yes we will. (gives her a kiss, and the pink bow tapes itself to his head.)"
rachel,ross?
ross,huh?
monica,(shouts to chandler) and make sure our room isn't next to theirs (points to phoebe).
rachel,"ooh! you guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. that's all, i just wish i could (looks at joey who is at the check in desk) share that with a guy."
phoebe,not joey.
rachel,"not joey, no, i was just lusting after chandler."
monica,"yeah, right!"
chandler,"tonight?! (looks at the ring) isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) oh, there it is!"
chandler,(slaps him on the shoulder) nice! (goes to monica)
chandler,"monica, can i talk to you for a sec? (pulls her away from phoebe and rachel)"
monica,ok!
chandler,"oh, you mind if i join you?"
joey,"actually, er, i would rather to be alone. you know i really need to…organize my thoughts."
chandler,your thoughts? plural?
joey,"alright, fine. i only have one thought. it’s about the hot nanny. i've got to see her."
chandler,i’m afraid i can’t let you do that joe.
joey,"now you’re telling me i can’t see her? you guys are killing me. she’s a forbidden fruit. it’s like, like, she’s the princess and i’m the stable boy (chandler looked irritated). why are you doing this, huh? did ross tell you not to let me to go over there?"
chandler,"yes, as a matter of fact, he did. so i can’t let you go."
joey,huh? interesting. now there are obstacles. hot nanny and me against the world. this is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
rachel,what?
rachel,no! that's ok! that's ok! that's ok! no no no no! this is my business associate gavin. he's just being silly.
rachel,ok.
rachel,i thought it was ross.
rachel,there isn't. there is totally isn't.
rachel,"all right. look. gavin...i...i guess i felt guilty that you were here, which i shouldn't. you know ross and i are not in"
rachel,yes
rachel,people keep saying that. oh i'm sorry gavin
rachel,"ooh, i have another idea!"
monica,"i'm sorry, idea time is over."
phoebe,"ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?"
monica,yeah.
chandler,what about the ones you have on the nightstand?
monica,there are no tickets on the nightstand!
chandler,"yes there are, i just saw them a few minutes ago."
monica,"un, no you didn't! you must be mistaken!"
chandler,"honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!"
monica,"chandler, sense the tone!!"
rachel,"well, well, well, look what mommy found!!"
monica,"ok, fine!! i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler."
monica,"okay ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and santa, the armadillo and i have a little talk in the kitchen? there's a sentence i'd never thought i'd say."
ross,(to chandler) what are you doing?
chandler,"you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work!"
ross,"thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave."
chandler,why?
ross,"because, i'm finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it."
chandler,but i didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
ross,"i'm sorry chandler, but this, this is really important to me."
chandler,"fine, i'll give the suit back."
monica,"(to chandler) hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (she has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling chandler's beard.)"
chandler,santa? really?
monica,"yeah, is that okay?"
joey,"oh...(nodding)i don't know why this is so hard for me...y'know what i mean? lying is basically just acting, and i am a terrific actor!(smirks)"
phoebe,you are a (looks down suddenly) terrific actor!
rachel,oh we just put her down for a nap.
ross,thank you amy!
ross,emma.
phoebe,phoe-be!
rachel,"honey, i don't know how to tell you this but, erm...but if something were to happen to ross or myself...[both of them knock on the wooden table]erm...you wouldn't get the baby."
ross,"well, we haven't officially asked them yet, but, we would want monica and chandler."
chandler,i can't believe you want us to raise emma!
monica,"do you know how many times i've seen him jump up like that, believe me i know what he was doing."
rachel,man sharks… i always knew there was something weird about that dude. but you promised to love him no matter what.
monica,what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone… not if he gets his jollys to jaws!
rachel,"ah! you know what honey guys are just different, they like things that we can't understand, you know i once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and i was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice."
monica,eww are you talking about my bother.
rachel,yeah i didn't disguise that very well did i.
joey,(enters) hey
rachel,(sits down) hi
joey,listen to this... i went out with this girl last night and half way through our date i realized i already slept with her.
monica,a love scene? with who?
rachel,olivia.
monica,"olivia? i thought she was marrying connor! (pause) oh right, real life more important."
rachel,so do you think that my dream means anything?
monica,"i don't know. i mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for joey, maybe you have a thing for drake."
rachel,ah! well it was joey reading drake's lines in the dream...
monica,"of course it was! trust me, when it comes to psychology i know what i'm talking about. i took two psych classes in college."
rachel,you took the same class twice.
monica,it was hard!
phoebe,hey!
phoebe,"here, monica, look what i got to wear when i play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) right? i mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man."
ross,are you gay? (rachel turns to ross in an embarrassed way)
rachel,ross!
rachel,oh!
rachel,"oh, that's pretty."
ross,(skeptic) so you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
ross,"(on a yeah, right tone) okay."
ross,"yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. (in the other room emma starts to cry.)"
rachel,"oh god, she mu... she must need her diaper changed."
rachel,"oh, that would be great! (sandy leaves for emma's room) i love him, i love him, i love him..."
ross,"oh, come on, rach, he's a guy!"
chandler,"i messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking."
monica,so what? don't you have any will power?
chandler,will power? i've watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs (?) without taking the tin foil off.
monica,you said that was sexy!
chandler,"'kay, look: can we just drop this? i'm not gonna smoke again."
monica,"that's right, because i forbid you to smoke again."
chandler,you forbid me?
monica,mhmm.
chandler,"you know, i flew a long way t see my loving wife? is she here by the way?"
monica,"don't joke (?) with me, okay? i'm very, very upset right now."
chandler,"oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?"
monica,yes.
phoebe,what are the chances? 1 billion chinese people and they send mike!?
monica,(to mike) what are you doing here?
monica,phoebe!
phoebe,"i'm sorry, i broke down... i wanted to see him."
monica,damnit phoebe! how did you even call him?
phoebe,there is a speakerphone on the base unit...
monica,base unit! think monica! think!
monica,(to mike) this doesn't concern you!!
monica,"look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder."
phoebe,not if nothing happens. why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
monica,"sure! if you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe i'll join ya. you know, i'm your friend (to phoebe) and mike's friend (mike is sceptical)."
chandler,what d'ya know... it's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
joey,"whoo, whoo. wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that i'm sitting next to charlie after we broke up."
chandler,"yeah, it's almost if air barbados doesn't care about your social life."
joey,"look, does someone mind switching to sit with charlie?"
ross,"oh, i uh, i mean, i... dude, i spent the whole conference with charlie."
joey,i understand...
ross,"no, i'll do it. (he quickly grabs joey's boarding pass and gives joey his one.)"
chandler,wish i could switch with someone. i really don't wanna sit with allen iverson over there.
phoebe,"uhm... you know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin..."
phoebe,aaah... you're not good at this...
phoebe,"no, i think i can come over. it's saturday, right?"
phoebe,what?
joey,"absolutely. you’d do it for me! not that you’d ever have to, ‘cos i know how to keep my women completely satisfied."
ross,shouldn’t the pizza be here by now? they said 30 minutes or less. how long has it been?
ross,i do. i do. although it is actually a lager.
ross,i don’t know. we can look it up.
phoebe,"oh, god. do you remember the girls’ nights that we used to have? sitting around, talking about you and ross?"
rachel,"oh, god. it seems like forever ago."
phoebe,i know.
phoebe,so what’s going on with you and ross?
rachel,"well, um, i don’t know. i mean, for a long time, nothing. you know, actually, right before you picked me up, ross and i had a little thing."
rachel,yeah...i don't know who i was kidding. i can barely use chopsticks.
rachel,oh thank you so much. oh oh wait! you forgot your erm...your game.
chandler,hey rach! there she is...my perfectly proportioned wife.
rachel,don't look at me i never get his jokes.
monica,thank you?
chandler,oh no..don't thank me. thank you. you know there's not one thing i would change about you? not one single thing! and definitely not...two...single things.
monica,ok...you're being wierd. do you want sex or did you do something bad?
chandler,no no! i just love the way you look... i am warm...for your form.
monica,ok..you know the old classics you know..you look nice? they're still ok.
chandler,"well yes yes...you look nice can mean that your face looks nice. i want to compliment your body. i mean..i wouldn't change it..at all. and more specifically, i wouldn't want anything to get any bigger."
monica,o..k...
chandler,i mean..you wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? don't answer that.
ross,and she feels the same way?
joey,i think so.
ross,"well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on."
joey,"yeah, but, ross, i mean, you're not okay with it."
ross,"no, but i wanna be. hey, i will be. besides, i'm with charlie, right? oh my god, i'm still with charlie, aren't i? i mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?"
joey,"no, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. are you sure about this?"
ross,"yeah, i'm sure."
joey,and we're okay?
monica,"hey, phoebs"
phoebe,hey.
monica,"uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. bill and colleen hate us."
phoebe,hey!
monica,"(excited) oh my god, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? i can barely control myself."
phoebe,"monica, you might want to remember that you are married. where is chandler anyway? (looks around)"
monica,(shocked) oh my god! chandler!
chandler,where the hell is everybody?
monica,"(to rachel) hey! joey said no autographs! but if she's gettting one, then i want one too: to monica. and none of this ""best wishes"" crap. i want ""love""."
rachel,"ok actually mon, matthew was just giving me his phone number."
monica,oh man! if i had known i was coming to this party i never would have gotten married!
rachel,nice to meet you.
chandler,(very seriously) that's really not the kind of thing we are looking for zack.
monica,"oh, friends first, drunk in london, you know the story. i've got a better question for you: do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?"
monica,"eh... heart disease, alzheimers, gout?"
monica,we're just making conversation. (chandler makes an agreeing-sound)
chandler,"you know what's not funny? male pattern baldness (monica stretches her neck to look behind zack's head and then gives chandler an ""ok"" sign)"
chandler,i noticed you were enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. did you have braces as a child?
monica,yess!! (m & c high-five and zack looks confused again)
chandler,(proceeding with his dinner) we're teeth people zack!
rachel,alright! let's just do it. let's just go over there and see if she heard.
phoebe,good plan.
chandler,"(smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. i can't believe i didn't even think of that. i guess i was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'..."
chandler,"(stares at her intently, then yells) it was a ""wendy's!! """
phoebe,"(singing) ""ipan stripan, glupi glabi! "" and that is the swedish national anthem! thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)"
rachel,"wow, ikea... what a rich culture. uhm, you know what? i have a friend who is a masseuse."
phoebe,"oh, ja! ja!"
rachel,yah! she's... uhm... not very good though... (phoebe looks devastated)
phoebe,"uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?"
rachel,i don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
phoebe,or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!
rachel,(now lifts her head) phoebe!!
chandler,"i know, i went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. you have to let me in."
ross,really? did you count mississipily?
ross,"dude, you're not tanned."
chandler,"no, i just had to get a picture of this."
chandler,i see you later!
rachel,you're pretty.
chandler,"whatever i decide to do, i'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. it's gonna be a while before i make a living at it. maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family."
ross,so you have to tell monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
chandler,yeah.
ross,(hugs chandler) good-bye.
monica,"(enters) okay, it's baby time. pants off bing. (sees ross) didn't see you there geller."
chandler,"yeah, ross is here so..."
ross,"yeah, and i was really hoping that i could hang out. what do you feel like doing?"
monica,we're gonna have sex.
ross,i don't feel like having sex. maybe we can watch a movie or something.
monica,let me put it this way. we're having sex whether you're here or not.
ross,pants off bing!
chandler,david is going to propose to phoebe tonight!
monica,see what happens when you give people advice? i hope you told him not to?
chandler,that would be advice!!
monica,ok fine. i'll handle this. (goes to phoebe who's talking to rachel) phoebe?
phoebe,yeah?
monica,(looking very serious) i need to talk to you.
phoebe,"are you leaving ""the supremes""? (monica and phoebe go to one side)"
monica,"ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. look, david is going to propose to you tonight."
phoebe,wow? really? that's fantastic!
monica,what are you serious? you wanna marry him? wha... what about mike?
phoebe,"oh, ok, you want me to marry mike? alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. i can just see it: ""mike, do you take phoebe..."" (gestures with her hand as if someone is covering her mouth and tries to shout ""no! no!"") you know, it's every girl's dream!"
monica,do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
phoebe,"sure! look, ok, bottom line: i love mike... david! david. i love david. don't look at me that way, roseanne rosannadanna!"
ross,"by using ct scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century."
chandler,great novels?
joey,fine. mediocre porn!
rachel,rachel greene’s office. give me the phone.
rachel,"hello, this is rachel greene. how can i help you? uh- huh. ok then. i’ll pass you back to your son. (she hands back the phone)"
rachel,hmm. excuse me gavin. i have a question i need to ask you.
rachel,"if you like looking at butt so much, why don’t you just go look at a mirror?"
rachel,"oh no, please i don’t care enogh about you to bug me. in fact, from now on, i’m going to take the high road. and i’m going to be very, very nice to you. you're mama’s boy starting right now."
rachel,so seriously...rodeo clown?
phoebe,"""no time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!"" thank you!"
phoebe,hi hi...oh you have got to sing.
monica,no i told you i can't.
phoebe,but you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.
monica,what have you heard me sing?
phoebe,all the time when you're cooking.
monica,what?
phoebe,"yeah you're always singing ""yummy yummy yummy, i've got love in my tummy"""
monica,yeah i do rock that one.
phoebe,uh! the psychic also said that i would be betrayed.
ross,"i can't believe this, i thought we were all in this together!"
monica,"hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!"
ross,3 minutes ago!!! i don't know why that's important ...
joey,"i was with you the whole time we were in connecticut, when did you even get those?"
monica,when you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
joey,(to ross) i'll show you how.
rachel,"ok, well monica, suppose one of your ""special"" tickets win? how are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?"
monica,"please ... if i win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and i couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!"
rachel,"chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?"
chandler,"(to mon) she's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ..."
chandler,did your dad ever dress up like santa?
monica,no.
chandler,then it's okaaay! (they kiss.)
chandler,"you know what, everybody? go home. you should be with your familys. it's bad enough that we're working new year's eve."
chandler,"good, god's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door, turns around and sees wendy) you're not gonna go?"
chandler,ah. thanks.
chandler,ah. (the phone rings; he answers it) chandler bing.
monica,hi honey! we're all here; we just want to wish you a merry christmas.
monica,"yeah, oh my god..i'm so moved."
rachel,"amy, see, we're alot closer to monica and chandler. we see them everyday, and truthfully, honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby."
chandler,"you know guys, i gotta say this, this means so much to me. that you'd trust me, with your child...i mean, we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own, and i've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but...that you two....that you two..."
monica,"ok...it's time for dinner! erm...everyone, we're using our fancy china, and erm, it's very expensive...so pleaaase be careful."
ross,"whoa.....whoa......[laughs, then almost drops the plate but catches it. his expression turns serious.] whoa!"
monica,"ok er...just to be clear, comedy with the plates, will not be well-received. [monica pinches ross' arm. ross flinches.]"
joey,hey!! how come my plate is less fancy than everyone elses? do you not trust me with the fancy plate?
monica,"no!!! honey that's...that's a special plate! see, it's a game! whoever gets that plate, wins!"
rachel,"monica, is ross' sister."
rachel,so basically you've slept with all the woman in new york and now you're just going around again.
joey,well that's not even the weird part… i don't think she remembered sleeping with me.
monica,but you don't remember sleeping with her.
joey,"yeah but she should remember sleeping with me i am very memorable, you guys know."
rachel,"what, how do we know, we never slept with you."
joey,and who's fault is that.
monica,"what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night"
joey,hey! i never have an off night ok although sometimes when i'm a little bloated i don't feel very sexy but even then i'm better then most!
monica,honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.
rachel,"yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other."
joey,interesting… all right i'll go out with her again and try to get past it (reaches for the chips) oh salt bloaty!
monica,"joey, joey."
joey,what?
monica,"oh...phoebe? maybe i wasn't clear before. i really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place."
phoebe,"right, yeah, ok, i'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault."
monica,"phoebe, it's not what you wear. it's sort of your songs... i just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore."
phoebe,"oh, ok. fine, i'll just, i'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot)."
rachel,"hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work..."
phoebe,my songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
rachel,"ok, we're still on that."
monica,i didn't say your songs were not good enough.
phoebe,then what's wrong with them? would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
monica,tiny portions?
phoebe,"yeah well, ""excuse me, i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) i can't see it, i can't see it""!"
rachel,"so wh..? he's smart, he's qualified. give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out."
ross,"because, it's weird!"
rachel,why?
ross,what kind of job is that for a man? a nanny? i-it's like if a woman wanted to be...
rachel,"(she's got that ""yeah, try to say it"" look on her face) yes?"
ross,king?
rachel,"(whispering and begging) please? (ross makes a ""whatever"" gesture) yes! sandy you're hired."
rachel,oooh... ***i really can't hear what she says*** come here.
ross,you gotta be at least bi...
chandler,"hey! (joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. chandler waits for joey to finish.) i need you to set me up for a joke. later, when monica is around, i need you to ask me about fire trucks."
chandler,"then, i might as well ... (graps the cigs) do this (lights one, exhales). not really sure what to do now."
monica,"well, i'll tell you what we're gonna do: we are already late for phoebe's birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, we're gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex."
chandler,fine. what!?
monica,"sex! this is the last day i'm ovulating, and when we don't do it now, we'll have to wait till next month. (walks towards bedroom)"
chandler,you serious? (follows)
monica,oh yeah!
chandler,"right, fine, i'll do it, but no talking."
monica,"huh, and no cuddling."
chandler,and no kissing your neck.
monica,"oh good, i hate it when you do that"
phoebe,sit down.
monica,oh wow wow wow!! make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them)
monica,i've been pretty good!
phoebe,"thanks, you look good too."
monica,oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. keep it clean!
phoebe,so how's the piano playing going?
phoebe,i've missed you too.
monica,"you know, on the way over here, i saw this drunk guy throw up. and then a pigeon ate it!"
chandler,"hey, ross, i just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?"
ross,"uhu uhu, check this out. (chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)"
phoebe,why not?
phoebe,you have a... you have a date? with who?
phoebe,(lets go of his hand) you have... have a girlfriend?
phoebe,for how long?
phoebe,"three months? okay... this is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?"
phoebe,"oh, okay... good. you do that. and then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you."
phoebe,"you know what, we're gonna have sex. let's just leave it there."
ross,"right, i'm gonna go talk to joey. i think this is the right time. he's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says ""duty free""."
rachel,ross is coming over. i think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
phoebe,woah! oh my god! i love things! what happened?
rachel,"well, um, first he told me that he liked how i looked, and then, erm, we had a little, erm, eye contact."
phoebe,eye contact?
rachel,uh huh.
phoebe,i hope you were using protection.
phoebe,"should we send them something back? yes, let’s do! let’s send them mashed potatoes!!"
rachel,"no, wait, don’t do that! it’s gonna make them think that they can come over here!"
phoebe,"so, what if they do?"
rachel,we’re not here to meet guys. you have a boyfriend. i have a…baby and a ross.
phoebe,"yeah, but, um, nothing has to happen. just having fun. you know, not everything has to go as far as ‘eye contact’."
monica,"chandler, you have to tell joey that you are not in tulsa."
rachel,just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
monica,i know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
rachel,i don't know! i mean...what brought that on?
monica,oh my god. we're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
rachel,no...you really think that's what it is?
monica,"you heard him! ""no bigger!"" ""you're perfect!"" ""just don't get any bigger!"" oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. you know what? i'm going to have to talk to chandler."
rachel,yeah! if you don't i will! of course your body's gonna change. your breasts are gonna get bigger..your ass is gonna get bigger...you're gonna lose bladder control. (she starts sobbing) god! it's just such a magical time!
phoebe,hi
ross,hey!
phoebe,"listen, i wanted to ask you something about marriage."
chandler,"owen didn't know he was adopted, and monica told him."
monica,what?
phoebe,"still, he had to find out sometime."
chandler,"yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?"
chandler,i'm gonna go tell emma she was an accident. (runs off.)
rachel,ok
monica,(yelling after him) we will!!
monica,(to rachel) look at you with all the guys!
rachel,yeah!
monica,i guess you have forgotten all about joey?
rachel,"yeah, well, i guess i have forgotten about joey and clearly you've forgotten about chandler!"
monica,please... chandler is the love of my life... (at which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! have mercy! (follows the man in the leather)
ross,"(to charlie) so, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave boston, huh?"
ross,"ooh... so sad... still, it can't be easy for you to leave harvard? especially after working alongside a nobel prize winner like albert wintermeyer?"
ross,you... you dated albert wintermeyer?
rachel,ok. (phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. rachel sees and follows her) wha...? where? where are you going?
phoebe,"oh! i'm sorry rachel, i don't have time for your childish games, ok? i still have to go find something incredible to wear so i can beat mike at ""who's more over who""! (at which she walks away)"
rachel,"(to charlie) hey, hi! hey, where've you been?"
rachel,"(pretends to be stunned) oh! wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? well, that's so weird! phoebe and i were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. god it's just such a small world!"
rachel,"oh god. you did. you heard. ok, listen, let me explain."
rachel,(after a pause) yeah.
rachel,"yeah! that's phoebe. that's phoebe. you know, she just wants them all! it's like she's a nympho!"
rachel,yeah...
rachel,(looks ashamed) i try...
ross,(to the still half asleep professor) oh my god! you really want me to be the keynote speaker? thank you! (hugs him whilst still on his lap)
phoebe,you know it's me?
rachel,"for like a half an hour! man, you can lie about sweden!"
phoebe,how can you come here?
rachel,how could you not tell me you worked here?
phoebe,i don't have to tell you everything!
rachel,"yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!"
phoebe,tips not included.
rachel,"oh! phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?"
phoebe,"because i was ashamed ok? i sold out for the cash! and then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401k. but you know... you pay a price. now i'm this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh! paying taxes!"
rachel,"phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! be true to what you believe in! honey, you have principles and i so admire that! i don't have any!"
phoebe,you know what? you are right. i am gonna quit. it's time i took my life back!
rachel,good for you pheebs!
rachel,"alright. now that i'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?"
rachel,"hey, they were popular when i left!"
rachel,"well, i should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?"
rachel,"oh, no no no no. i see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. okay, i've had it for five years, and i know how it works, so why don't you just"
rachel,(sits down in her chair) oh god. you've totally messed with the back support of my chair. how do you fix this?
rachel,"fine, i will. (pushes that button thing on the chair that makes it ""collapse"") alright, fill me in!"
ross,hey.
chandler,hey.
ross,you have a blue tie that would go with this? emma spit up on mine.
ross,"oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because i won't be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. (someone knocks on the door, ross goes to open and it's joey, rachel and chandler)."
joey,hey guys!
ross,the chocolates aren't here yet.
joey,damnit!
chandler,"oh, is it on the computer, cuz i'd love to give it a read...?"
ross,"if you want to check your email, just ask! (chandler tries to look offended)"
chandler,(offended) what? (pause) may i?
rachel,"(looking out the window) what's with the rain, geller? i mean, when i signed up for dino week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season."
rachel,it's not the time charlie.
chandler,"(at the laptop) oh, no, no, no dear god, no!"
joey,"oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? (chandler looks annoyed at him and joey leans in to him) oh! secret teapot?"
monica,hey rach.
rachel,hi.
monica,you’re ready for your birthday lunch?
rachel,"i am. oh but first, monica, i would like to introduce you to my very talented colleague and more importantly my wonderful friend, gavin mitchell."
monica,please to meet you. so you’re coming to rachel’s party today?
rachel,"oh no no no no. gavin, cant. he’s already has plans. mostly likely with his mother."
rachel,why did you invite him? i can’t stand that guy.
monica,you're just being so nice to him.
rachel,i was faking it. can’t you tell when i’m being fake?
rachel,"hey mr phillip, nice suit."
phoebe,ok so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
monica,just a little but...it's just so scary! i don't even know what i would sing...
monica,"""delta dawn"""
ross,"hi! i could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace"
ross,"right, so that's a firm ""no"". i cannot believe this, i just keep striking out."
chandler,"i don't get it neither, i mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed"
ross,this is great. rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and i'm gonna die alone.
chandler,by drowning or...?!
chandler,well...
monica,ahhh! (shocked)
chandler,"let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, it doesn't look like i'm gonna get this job so i can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from rachel)"
monica,there's the man i married!!
rachel,"all right, believe me.if you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!"
monica,"fine! don't be my friends! i'll buy new friends! yeah, and then i'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!"
rachel,"(surprised) oh! alright, you know what? that's it! i want my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!"
joey,"yeah, i want my tickets too (takes the bowl from rachel)! and i'm buying the knicks! and steffi graff, ah ah!"
ross,"than i want mine, too (takes the bowl from joey)! and if i win i'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond."
phoebe,"oh, you guys! we've got to keep all the tickets together (takes the bowl from ross and puts it on the table)"
monica,"no, no! we should divide them up (picks up the bowl) and i should get extra because we used my card to buy them!"
phoebe,(simultaneous to the others) ble-blah-blar blargh!
chandler,"ahh, merry christmas; i miss you guys!"
monica,so is it horrible? is everybody working really hard?
chandler,"ah, well no, it's just uh, me and wendy."
monica,wendy? -- that sounds like a girl's name.
chandler,it is. did i... not tell you about her?
monica,"umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about new year's eve. where is everybody else?"
chandler,i send them home.
monica,"ohh, you are such a good boss! is she pretty?"
chandler,"uhh, uh..."
ross,"(in a low voice) answer faster, answer faster!"
chandler,i don't know!
monica,that was me.
rachel,amy!! you've got to stop doing that.
monica,"ok...listen er...i know that you're having a little bit of a family crisis but you don't have to take it out on the plates! in fact i think, that, everyone, should erm...cut their food like this! (proceeds to cut a turkey drumstick in mid-air over the plate) now, see? this way you protect the plates, and let's face it. you have fun."
chandler,no...if crazy plate lady...[catches himself in mid-sentence] if monica dies...then...i would get emma...right?
rachel,"well, actually...."
chandler,actually what?
ross,er...it's just that in that case...then erm...emma would go to my parents.
chandler,what??!
joey,er... who has to die for me to get her?
monica,you don't think sharks are sexy do you?
joey,no… (pause) wait a minute what was the little mermaid?
phoebe,it's open.
ross,hey!
phoebe,hey! mike called were going out again! yay! yay! (she dances around with happiness)
ross,"yay! (he continues the happiness with her by dancing around) quick thing, i went to talk to mike."
phoebe,what? wha-wha-wha-did you do ross!
ross,"oh boy you got mad at that part. i went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me blah, blah, blah, and i ended up telling him that…"
phoebe,what!
ross,umm… that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named vicrum.
monica,"phoebe, it's not about quantity."
phoebe,well...it's not about quality.
monica,"oh really, you want to talk about quality? have you heard of a key? it's what some people sing in."
phoebe,"well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. yeah, there are other ingredients monica."
monica,"ok, so that's what we're doing. you know, when i'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, i'm wearing ear plugs."
phoebe,"ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?"
monica,"you know what? i take back what i said before. you keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy."
phoebe,"what are people having, the garlic martini?"
chandler,"oh we did, and you still have all your lamps."
chandler,"oh, i didn't factor in the room tax."
ross,"oh dude, don't worry about it, i found an unattended maid's car. we're way ahead of the game."
ross,oh my god.
joey,ooh. i-i don't know chan. i'm not so good with remembering lines.
chandler,"(can't believe what he hears) well, thank god your livelihood doesn't depend on it."
joey,"i know, right? (chandler has really big eyes, and nods) wh... wh... why are we doing this?"
chandler,monica says that her maitre d. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
joey,seriously? she actually said that?
chandler,yes! am i crazy to be this upset?
joey,nooooo! being funny is your thing!
chandler,yeah!
joey,"without that, you just got ""lame with women""."
chandler,"ye.... (stops because he realises what joey just said, and stares at him. at this moment monica enters)"
monica,hi! there you are.
chandler,and lots of kissing your neck.
ross,"okay, well the ??? is not home."
rachel,no. uch.
ross,"oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. and she has the keys."
rachel,"alright, i can't, i can't wait that long. you have to do something--knock that door down!"
ross,"i would, but i bruise like a peach. besides, y...you know, everything is gonna be fine. the baby's sleeping."
rachel,what if she jumped out the basinet?
ross,"can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped."
rachel,"oh my god, i left the water running."
ross,"rach you did not leave the water running. please, just pull yourself together, okay?"
rachel,"ah, did i leave the stove on?"
chandler,huh! so that's what i would look like if i worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. you're not actually going to send these out are ya?
ross,"eh..actually no, i don't need to because your little ""ross is dead"" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that i'm dead. (silence) oh my god! nobody cares that i'm dead!?"
chandler,"no, come on, you know that's not true."
ross,what are you talking about? you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! i didn't get one response! and i'm dead!
chandler,"well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community."
ross,i can't believe this. not even my geology lab partner? and i carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)
chandler,"alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? that people are gonna post condolences on a website? this is not about people not caring that you're dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief."
ross,you're right. there isn't a decent outlet.
chandler,"right, i mean, come on, i'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come."
joey,i guess so. i'm just... really nervous.
rachel,"okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner."
joey,ooh...
rachel,still nervous?
joey,i'm gonna get the lasagna.
ross,hey rach...
rachel,yeah!
ross,do you mind if i sit here for a sec.?
rachel,"yeah, yeah sure! yeah! (mouths ""good luck"" to joey and gets up from her seat)"
ross,hey!
joey,hey!
ross,"so, i uhm... kinda need to talk to you about charlie."
chandler,don’t you think it’s better for him to think that you’re cheating on me than for him to think that i'm cheating on him? [silence] i heard it!
monica,i don’t want him to think that i'm having an affair.
chandler,alright. i’ve got a plan. i’ll go down the fire escape…
monica,yes. because all good plans start with “i’ll just go down the fire escape…”
chandler,"hear me out, woman! i’ll go down the fire escape, then i’ll wait for a while. then, when i come back up the stairs, it’ll just be like i got back from tulsa. then, joey and i will come in here and see that there is no guy in here."
monica,aren’t you afraid that joey’s going to figure all this out? [silence] i heard it!
chandler,just gonna wait for a little while.
monica,scary pigeon’s back?
chandler,it’s huge!
rachel,"oh my god! i can’t believe you live in that building! my grandmother lives in that building, ida green? no sense of personal space? kinda smells of chicken? looks like a potato?!?"
ross,oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? i mean i can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
phoebe,no...i really wanted to know how you feel about it.
ross,why?
phoebe,mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
ross,never?
phoebe,never.
ross,wow...are you still going to move in with him?
phoebe,"i want to...but i just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. you know...that i won't, i won't be missing out on anything. that marriage stinks!"
ross,yeah...marriage...stinks! i mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? get them married.
phoebe,that's not how you really feel is it?
ross,"no, i'm sorry. look i don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but i can't help it. i love marriage."
ross,... and you called him alby!? (laughs) i mean that's like... like calling albert einstein... er... alby...
ross,"eh, you think? i mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!"
ross,"(very interested) oh! like what?! (charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) oh i'm sorry, i don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch ""access hollywood""."
ross,who is intimidating to a guy who won the nobel prize?
ross,(a little suprised) two? wha...? don't tell me you dated benjamin hobart
ross,oh my god! have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the nobel prize?
ross,"oh yeah? no, no nobel prizes for him?"
ross,huh... huh... what a loser! some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)
phoebe,hey ross!
joey,(impressed) wow! you look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! which is like the highest level of hotness!
phoebe,are you sure? because i'm really dreading going to this party.
joey,then don't go!
phoebe,"mike knows i'm coming, and if i don't show up he'll think it's because of him! and i don't want to lose face! that's a very serious thing in my culture."
joey,"alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over mike. and afterward you come to my place and i'll get you good and drunk!"
phoebe,"you got it! ok. but not on the wine that you made, ok, because i just don't want to go back to the emergency room."
phoebe,david?
phoebe,oh my god! (they hug)
phoebe,yeah. what-what are you doing here?
phoebe,ok.
phoebe,"okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and whispers) if you guys have microphones in there too, i didn't mean any of that. i love you."
ross,"haha! got ya! die, die, die!"
ross,"(recovers his composure and starts typing) respectfully, professor r. geller. (hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins charlie on the sofa) hey!"
ross,"hey, how was the met?"
ross,"yeah? joey really knows his art, huh?"
ross,what do you mean?
chandler,"oh, yeah. but you have to give it back if i get a job. of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits."
monica,"(enters from the bedroom) hi, good morning lover. i gotta say after last night, i'm a little weak in the knees."
ross,here's an idea. you walk into a room...take a quick scan!
monica,(to ross) sorry. (to chandler) but i kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
chandler,"oh god, i have to tell you something. you're not pregnant."
monica,what are you talking about?
chandler,that thing that i have to do to make a baby. i faked it.
monica,what!? you faked it?
ross,"you know what? i don't need a tie. i mean, it's better, open collar. you know, it's more casual (he leaves.)"
phoebe,"joey, listen. i can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. yesterday i was a nurse, and today i'm a waitress at a cafe?"
chandler,"your computer, i don't know wha... everything's gone!"
ross,wha... what do you mean? (goes to the laptop)
chandler,it must be a virus. i think it erased your hard drive.
ross,"what, oh my god. what did you do?"
chandler,someone i don't know sent me an e-mail and i opened it.
ross,"why, why would you open it?"
chandler,"well, it didn't say ""this is a virus""!!"
ross,what did it say?
chandler,nude... (ross looks at him)... pictures of anna kournikova. i'm so sorry.
ross,"what... what am i gonna do? my speech is gone, chandler!"
chandler,"it's not gone! i mean, i'm sure you printed out a copy. you have a hard copy, right?"
ross,no! i don't!!
monica,right there. (pointing her finger at rachel) that was so fake.
rachel,shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
rachel,still can’t believe you invited gavin. he is just the last person i want to see.
monica,welcome for the party. i’m glad you’re having a good time.
rachel,god i hope he doesn’t show up. of course he’s not going to show. that guy hates me.
monica,does he?
rachel,what?
monica,"may be if he bothers you so much, because he likes you. it was like in first grade when skippy lang would always push me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me."
rachel,oh monica. you think skippy liked you? honey all those boys had a fantasy if they can knock you over.
rachel,"oo, ok. thanks you. (molly walks out)"
ross,i know! (he stands)
monica,wait wait! i can't sing in front of all these people.
phoebe,"just pretend they're not even here! it's ok monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone"
monica,"hi! i'm monica and i'm gonna be singing ""delta dawn"""
phoebe,can you totally see through her shirt ?
monica,"""to take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"""
joey,"hey, i need your help."
chandler,"wow, it seems serious. what seems to be the problem, ashley judd?"
joey,"look, i'll get new headshot taken, all right, so i want to get my eyebrows shaped"
joey,"hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! this all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from monica)"
chandler,"oh, yeah! thanks for inventing the lottery!"
rachel,"ok, that's it! just give'em to me! i'll split them up! (she tries to snatch the bowl from joey's hands but she can't, so she pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)"
joey,(in pain) oh!
phoebe,(she takes the bowl from rachel's hands and she starts running around the room and yelling) ooooohhhhh!
ross,"(trying to stop her) hey, hey!!"
phoebe,"(keeping on running and yelling) ooooohhhhh! (she stops) fine, i can't take it anymore! i'm putting an end to this! (she goes out to the balcony)"
rachel,"oh, if she jumps, i get her tickets."
joey,"no, no! (they all go towards the balcony but they get jammed in the window)"
phoebe,"if we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! so, say goodbye to your tickets! (she holds out the bowl, and makes as to drop the tickets on the street)."
phoebe,don't come any closer!
chandler,"can i come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished..."
ross,"(in the same low voice) answer better, answer better!"
chandler,"i don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague."
monica,what does she do there?
chandler,"oh, she's regional vice president; she's... just below me."
monica,she did what?
chandler,be-low me!
joey,"ahh, wait, is wendy the runner-up miss oklahoma?"
monica,*what*??
chandler,"well, she... she didn't win..."
monica,"alright, well, maybe i should let you and the second prettiest girl in oklahoma get back to work."
chandler,"well, second prettiest that year; i mean, of *all* the girls in oklahoma, she's probably..."
chandler,"so, if monica's not around, i'm not good enough to raise emma?"
ross,"no, that's not what we are saying..."
joey,yeah! he's lying he looked down! (phoebe nods in agreement)
chandler,"what...what is wrong with me? am i, am i incompetent? because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!"
rachel,"honey, you're taking this the wrong way. we think you're going to be a wonderful parent! it's just that, you're more the...y'know, fun parent."
ross,"yeah! and we wanna make sure that emma also has someone like monica, who's more of a disciplinarian...someone who can be firm, and strict."
monica,that's not how you see me is it?
phoebe,"no, you're all about the fun. (phoebe is cutting her food like monica told everyone to)"
chandler,"look, i may not know alot about babies, but you really think i'm not capable?"
ross,"no...you both are equally capable. it's just that you're strongest, when you're together."
chandler,"ok, so if we both had emma, and i die [knocks fist on table] she'd have to give her up."
ross,sure! monica would have to give her up.
phoebe,what! why?
ross,well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
phoebe,(walks towards ross) if you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend i swear to lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers right now!
ross,"well phoebe, i think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about vicrum, his a kite designer (he makes a wow face) and he used to date oprah. (he makes another wow face)"
phoebe,"i'm not going along with some lie you made ross, no i'm just gonna be honest with him."
ross,good yeah just be honest with him.
phoebe,"yeah i've nothing to be ashamed of ok so i haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. ok i haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave… which he will and that's ok… so i'll just be alone forever you know alright i'll be… it'll be fine… it'll be fine… i'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. oh (takes a deep breath and sits down, knock on the door)"
ross,i'll get it
phoebe,ok
phoebe,"uh huh yeah (stands up) there's just something umm, there's something you should know (pause) vicrum just called."
chandler,what?
ross,there's something new in the bowl.
chandler,"look, we have enough, just walk away."
ross,"no, but i want...i want the pinecones!"
chandler,there's a forest right outside.
ross,it's not the same.
chandler,"ok, go quick!"
ross,(to the receptionist) thank you for a delightful stay.
ross,"oh, my maple candy!"
phoebe,(singing) food here at 'javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'javu' ...will kill you..
monica,"thank god, it's just you! i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall."
phoebe,"you'd better get back in that kitchen monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself."
joey,"(sees monica) fire trucks! (chandlers eyes double in size and he turns to monica who doesn't understand what's happening. then he turns back to joey, who says ""you're welcome"" without a sound)"
phoebe,oof...
phoebe,"oh, wait, wait!"
phoebe,"no, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) uhm... remember when you asked me if i was seeing someone and i said no? well, uhm... i am. his ... his name is mike."
phoebe,"yeah, i should have told you."
phoebe,"i'm sorry, i'm sorry."
phoebe,i am happy.
phoebe,"well... but david, just... i just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things i've ever had to do."
phoebe,"of course, yeah.(they hug and phoebe sighs... a little after that also david sighs and makes his way to the door) you know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate..."
ross,"you never cooked since 1996. (actually rachel cooked in ""609 - tow ross got high"", first aired 1999-11-25.)"
rachel,"is the window open? because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there."
ross,"oh my god, you know what, yeah, i think you're right. i think .. listen, listen!"
rachel,ubb.
ross,"a pigeon, a pigeon. (previously scared rachel turns away) no, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. landed on the stove and caught fire. the baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. the eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. baby and bird still up lays (?) are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment."
rachel,"boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true."
joey,maybe we should just eat now.
joey,"wha-a how about this: another table leaves, right? but there's still some food left on their place, okay, what's the restaurant's policy about people eatin' that?"
ross,exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)
chandler,"ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)you're having a memorial service for yourself!?"
ross,no! that would be stupid! you're having it for me!
chandler,"ross, don't press send, don't press se... !"
ross,"oh, too late, too late! it's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man..."
rachel,"i'm trying to put emma down for a nap, have you seen hugsy?"
joey,original or crappy?
rachel,original.
joey,"no, sorry haven't seen him."
rachel,then what's that big lump under your covers?
joey,"it's monica, ok?"
rachel,that's not monica!
joey,"alright!! fine! it's original hugsy! no, now i know that emma wants him but he's mine and i need him.."
joey,yeah?
ross,"okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... well, charlie and i were talking, and..., well..."
joey,you kissed.
ross,wha... (gasps) what? what would give you that idea?
joey,i saw you.
ross,"yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay."
joey,"ross, ross, ross... it's okay."
ross,what?
joey,"it's okay. you know, i totally understand, alright? you guys, make way more sense than her and i ever did, you know. and... i want you to be happy."
ross,are you serious?
joey,yeah... now i have something...
ross,"i am speachless... i mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. i mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?"
rachel,yeah! that’s my muppy!
phoebe,"yeah, i’m sorry. we weren’t really looking for anything to happen with you guys. i-i have a boyfriend."
rachel,"oh, it’s complicated. i don’t actually have a boyfriend, but, erm…"
rachel,"i’m sorry, no."
rachel,"oh, sure!"
phoebe,oh my god! you’re giving your real number!
rachel,great. [gives thumbs up]
phoebe,"wow. so that's great. you, bill, ross and emma are going to be so happy together. what were you thinking?"
rachel,i don’t know. he was cute and he liked me. it was an impulse.
phoebe,seriously? you divorc-o?
ross,"if you have to call me name, i prefer ross the divorcer. it's just cooler. look...i know my marriage isn't exactly work out. but i love to be that committed to another person. and caroline and i had some good times before she became a lesbian! and once afterward. i'm sorry."
phoebe,it's ok that's how you feel.
ross,but come on! i mean living together will be great! i mean you guys have so much fun...and you love mike.
phoebe,i do love mike.
ross,yeah see? and you are so excited about moving in together before... and you know what? you should be. it's a big deal!
phoebe,yeah i guess you're right. yeah thanks. this helped. thanks.
ross,"the divorcer, to the rescue!"
phoebe,it's not cooler.
ross,yeah i just hurt it.
joey,rach?!
ross,(sarcastically) oh great! after i finish my wine i'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
phoebe,"oh, what's the matter?"
ross,"she... she only dates geniuses and nobel prize winners. oh my god, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, i put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth."
rachel,i always loved that!!
ross,"of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! (rachel nods) man, i can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my god!"
phoebe,worse?
ross,"oh much, much worse. i did my impression of joan rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) ""can we walk""? (phoebe starts laughing) oh, you... you like that?"
phoebe,(still laughing) no. (points to rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)
ross,what? (turns around to look at rachel)
rachel,come on! i think this is funny! (ross leaves)
chandler,"(to himself) oh yes, god yes!!"
phoebe,what happened?
phoebe,yeah?
phoebe,"well, it's great that you're back! how are you?"
phoebe,good!
phoebe,"(disappointed) oh, good for you."
phoebe,mike and i broke up.
phoebe,really?
phoebe,"i understand. yeah. ok so then ok, so we're both living in new york, not seeing anyone. that's so not like us!"
ross,"(perplexed for a moment) wait a minute... when you guys walked into the met, did you go to the right?"
ross,"(shaking head) oh joey, joey! but still, i mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together."
ross,what?
ross,"what, i mean, a little, but no, what, go on."
ross,"(slowly) yeah. but you know what? i think you should give joey a chance. i mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else."
ross,"and if you think about it, i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. you know, that's the kind of guy joey is."
ross,that was going to be my next argument.
joey,hey!
joey,"oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. it's okay."
phoebe,"well, it's not okay, because i gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. and now suddenly i'm the waitress? that's gonna confuse my fans."
joey,"maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress."
phoebe,"uhuh. because i'm a single mother, supporting my two children."
joey,nice.
phoebe,wait a minute. dr. drake ramoray and i work at the same hospital. wouldn't i come over to say hi to him?
joey,"no, no. see, you and drake are having a fight."
phoebe,about what?
joey,he slept with you and then never called you.
phoebe,and i just wanted a new daddy for davy and becky.
phoebe,"yeah, well, i'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back."
chandler,"well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!"
joey,it's really gone?
ross,yep! i'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
chandler,i just feel awful.
ross,"yeah, well you should! i mean, nude pictures of anna kournikova? i mean, she's never even won a major tournament!"
chandler,"well, i tried billy jean king, but... (ross glares at him) you know, you and monica have the same ""i'm gonna kill you"" look...? i can usually make it go away by kissing her... (ross continues to glare at him and chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss ross)"
ross,get out! (chandler runs out)
rachel,"you know, this happens all the time to my computer at work."
ross,"well, what do you do?"
rachel,"well, i usually go... play tetris on somebody else's computer."
ross,i can't believe this. i can't believe this is happening. i have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! ok? i have to stand up in front of all these people. what am i gonna say?
rachel,do you see what all the guys see in her?
monica,wouldn’t get her out of bed. no more vodka for me.
joey,hey rach. so can i sing happy birthday to you now?
rachel,"yes, sure."
joey,alllright. happy…birth (he saw molly opens the door. so he follows).see you later.
monica,"hey rach, somebody got you a shoes."
rachel,oh give me. (she opens the box)wow…argggg(she throws the box away) my god….
phoebe,careful. theses are my rat babies.
rachel,"grrr, you brought rats to my birthday party?"
monica,"(sitting up straight, looks like paralysed) so this what a stroke feels like."
phoebe,"i had to bring them. we killed their mother. they are our responsibilities now. you know they require constant care. you should that rachel, you’re a mother."
chandler,"i am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!"
joey,"you may be a sissy but i'll still (pound you out on ground). all right, it hurts so bad, i could only let her do one"
chandler,it’s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
joey,"all right, look, you got to help me out, ok? look, i have the magic marker, i want you to fill in the skinny one so"
chandler,"ok. first of all, this is green!"
joey,what the hell am i supposed to do!
chandler,"all right, i will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what i am about to tell you."
joey,"what, what."
chandler,"ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well i earned mine"
joey,oh my god!
chandler,"yeah, well, i guess you don’t need my help victor victoria!"
phoebe,"no, what's more important, your friends or money?"
monica,money! (they all look at her) friends...
phoebe,"hey monica, what about your extra tickets?"
monica,they're all in there! even these five that i hid in my bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to phoebe)...
ross,monica!
phoebe,"ok, good! (pause) you guys were so scared! there was no way i was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring phoebe who drops the bowl on the street) oh god, no! (pause) i think i broke your bowl."
ross,"go, go, go!!"
phoebe,"what a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. and the wind sure made it fun."
monica,"phoebe, we lost half of them."
phoebe,"so, what? monica, we have the winning ticket! my psychic said i was gonna win, remember?"
rachel,"(interrupting him) oh chandler, stop talking!"
chandler,"honey, there's really nothing to worry about."
monica,okay.
chandler,i'm serious!
monica,okay!
chandler,merry christmas.
monica,merry christmas.
chandler,"merry christmas, you guys!"
phoebe,"(simultaneous to the others) blah blargah, blar-blab."
chandler,"(hanging up the phone) the wife says ""hi!""."
chandler,"ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and i are alone, that something is gonna happen."
chandler,"this is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie."
joey,"i lie better than that right? (phoebe gives joey a ""of course!"" look)"
chandler,"so...so let me get this straight. so my two friends die, i get emma, then my wife dies, then emma the one-tiny-ray-of-hope left in my life, gets taken away from me?"
monica,hey...there you are. you disappeared after dinner.
chandler,"oh, did somebody miss me? is there a child to raise poorly?"
monica,ross and rachel don't know what they're talking about! i mean it's not like they're so responsible. emma as a product of a bottle of murlo and a five-year-old condom.
chandler,y'know but they're right. i'm not a strong father-figure and i never will be.
monica,no....you learn these things. you grow into it.
chandler,"yeah, but it's not who i am. everything they said is exactly why i was worried about having a kid. and it's true! and, look, everybody knows it."
monica,i don't know it! i want to have a kid with you because i think you're going to be an amazing dad. at the fun parts and at the hard parts.
chandler,"oh yeah, well, can you picture me saying, ""go to your room! you're grounded!"""
joey,"uh huh, sure, yeah. how can you not remember me?"
joey,how could you not remember that we slept together?
joey,i dunno!
joey,"come on, come on, search your brain all right… it was (thinks) a certain amount of time ago, i was here you were here, we had sex (starts pointing out the places) here, here, here not there. anything?"
joey,my god woman! how many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this?
joey,"ooooooooooh, i slept with you! and you obviously remember me hey! i still got it. (turns back to hayley) so were good. (she just glares at him) i'll let myself out."
phoebe,"…and i said vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with rachel."
phoebe,yeah well (pause) yeah you know emma's birth certificate might say geller but her eyes say mookurgee.
monica,"ok, you have to stop playing now."
phoebe,why? the only person my playing is bothering is you!
monica,"oh yeah? ok, let's settle this, come on!"
phoebe,(while monica drags her in the restaurant) get your garlic-peelers off me!
monica,"(to the restuarant customers) excuse me, excuse me, hi, i'm monica geller..i'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. ok, i was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands)"
phoebe,"ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) ha!"
monica,"alright, let me ask you this question: how many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again)."
phoebe,"ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?"
monica,ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)
phoebe,"ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands)."
monica,excuse us! (then to phoebe) alright here's a question: who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand)
phoebe,oh...who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)
phoebe,"i mean... (david kisses phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the door and turns around again)"
phoebe,yeah?
phoebe,"well, if that's what they do in minsk... (they kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... david turns to the door) in new york... it's... (and then david grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... they kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)"
rachel,(in a tearful voice) oh... oh boy... (she turns around and sees ross) hi...
ross,(very worried) is everything allright?
rachel,"oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful."
rachel,i can't... i can't hear it again.
ross,"and i'm fine never having heard it... (rachel looks at ross in a ""why do you say that"" manner) rach, can i... can i see you for a sec?"
joey,but it happens? (waiter leaves) i'm gotta go to the bathroom.
phoebe,"no, you can't go. no-no-no, i can't hold this table on my own. if they ask me to move, i cave."
joey,"if you ask me to stay, i'll pee. (leaves)"
phoebe,"okay, fine, i'll move. alright, you don't have to manhandle me. (gets up) where? (he points at a smaller table) okay. thank you. wach."
joey,"(returns to their old table where elderly people are sitting now, sits) finally you guys made it. (looks up, turns left to phoebe's chair) pheebs, who the hell--uhuhh!"
monica,spend more time with the tie. that'll make a baby.
chandler,"look, i can't do this. i can't make luv to you while we're fighting this way."
monica,"oh sure, now you're mister sensitivity. but when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral"
rachel,(to herself) oh god.
joey,... she's being unreasonable!
rachel,"(yelling) joey, there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much (joey covers hugsy's ears) oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) it's because it reminds her of her uncle joey!"
joey,it does?
rachel,yeah! and she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much.
joey,really? she... she loves me?
rachel,"oh yeah! but you know what? if you need hugsy, don't worry. emma will totally understand. i won't... but whatever (she leaves the room)."
joey,"ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, i mean rach, i mean if if... . if hugsy means that much to emma then... well she can have him."
rachel,"oooh... you're sweet, i knew uncle joey would step up. (turns to face emma in the the playpen) look emma, look who's baaack!"
joey,look forget it forget it... i can't do it.
joey,oh... uh... look... before you...
ross,"no, i mean it. you are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous..."
joey,"i am those things, yeah."
ross,"you know what? i know chandler longer, so i always think of him as my best friend, but now... i may have to rethink some stuff..."
joey,dude!
ross,"hey, if there is ever, anything i can do for you..."
joey,i can't think of anything.
ross,thanks!
joey,yeah.
rachel,so hi!
phoebe,but what about ross? what about your moment? don’t you want to talk to ross about it?
rachel,"no, no, ‘cos i know exactly how the conversation is going to go. “hey ross”, “you know, i think that we had a moment before” [as ross] “yeah, um, me too” [as herself] “well, but i’m not sure i really wanna do anything about it!” [as ross] “yeah, um, me, um, neither.” [as herself] “ross, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we’re really feeling?” [as ross] “yeah, that works for me, um, um.”"
phoebe,"yeah, i see what you mean. by the way, nice ross imitation. but your rachel was not whiney enough."
rachel,hey!
phoebe,better!
rachel,"the point is: maybe i should stop waiting around, waiting for moments with ross. i should just move on with my life."
phoebe,"so, really? are you moving on from ross?"
rachel,"dunno, do i have to decide right now?"
phoebe,you kinda just did. that guy’s gonna call you tonight. ross is going to pick up the phone. that’s a pretty clear message.
joey,rachel!!!!?
joey,so i can't do anything i like!??!?!?
chandler,hey rach! ah........perfection. (kisses monica) wouldn't change a thing. not a thing.
monica,honey?
chandler,yeah?
monica,about that? erm...i'm going to change.
chandler,but honey you don't have to.
monica,i'm going to get bigger!
chandler,honey i...i love your breasts the way they are!
rachel,argh. ***
monica,"well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! and you know what? it's not just my breasts. my ass is going to get bigger too."
chandler,i... i don't know... you seem lovely.
joey,"hey ross, this is one of my co-stars, dirk. (to dirk) dirk, this is my good friend ross. (ross and dirk shake hands)"
ross,nice to meet you.
ross,"oh, i'm no actor, i'm a professor of palaeontology."
joey,it's a science.
joey,"hey ross, listen, dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or..."
ross,"oh, well no, but i mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys."
ross,i'd lead with that.
phoebe,well... (pause) no.
phoebe,i'd love to.
phoebe,ok. (they walk away together)
phoebe,"oh, got it, stay upwind of me."
rachel,"no, that's david."
rachel,(disapprovingly) tip of the iceberg.
chandler,you sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
chandler,"are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression."
chandler,ok.
ross,hey!
joey,(to charlie) you're ready?
joey,"(aside, to ross) hey ross! that art stuff worked, you hooked me up."
ross,glad i could help man.
joey,"although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... (confidently) i made it work."
chandler,(picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in) it is not okay that i'm aroused by this now.
chandler,"hello? oh hi, doctor connelly. (pause) no, she's not here but, you know, i can tell her. should i be sitting down for this? (his smile fades as he hears the answer) oh. (pause) well, so what does that mean? (pause) ok. ok, thank you. thanks. (hangs up)"
monica,hey sweetie.
chandler,doctor connelly just called.
monica,"with good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) of course it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) ""doctor connelly just called"". if it was good news you would have said (excitedly) ""doctor connelly just called! "" but so what is it? is there a problem, uh? is there a problem with me or with you?"
joey,"oh, calm down! she means on the show! we need some new extras around here!"
rachel,"yes. emma and i came in a little early to do research on the presentation. i actually made a few changes, but i think i'm caught up on everything. so ask me anything!"
rachel,"except that! (mr. zelner enters) oh, hello, mr. zelner. we're all ready for our presentation this afternoon."
rachel,"what? i can't do that! i have the baby, and ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour."
rachel,"well, there you go. you win, you win. you get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that i worked here, and then ralph will buy his helicopter, and super gavin will just fly right along side of him!"
rachel,"no, i can't, i have a baby."
joey,i could teach you a speech that i memorized for auditions.
ross,"i don't think that your monologue from star wars is gonna help me right now, joe!"
ross,wha... what you really think we can do that?
joey,"hey don't worry about that! i mean, ross needs you! and rachel and i will stay and help anyway we can."
rachel,ugh.
ross,"alright, ok, let's do it. (ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) um, i know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... um, and then, then i move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the mesozoic era, the breakup of pangea, hello! (rachel and joey look confused) and then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the triassic."
joey,"oh, oh! any chance any of this happened in a ""galaxy far, far away""? (ross turns aroud and glares at him. joey and rachel decide to leave)."
monica,"ok, mike, enough is enough, now you love phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole ""i never want to get married"" thing and step up!"
rachel,you’re comparing my daughter to a rat?
phoebe,no. seven rats. (turns to mike) i think we should take them home. we need to feed them.
rachel,what? you are going to leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
phoebe,"i’m sorry rachel. but i’m not like you, ok? not everyone could afford help."
ross,(to chandler) hey. where the hell is joey and molly? i asked you to watch them.
chandler,(in helium voice) i’m sorry. i got a little preoccupied.
ross,"look. we have to stop them, before something happenes."
chandler,(helium voice) right behind you big guy.
joey,"so you see molly, what people don’t understand, is that acting, is a discipline. it takes a lot of hard work."
joey,"ok all right, no, no, no, no, i do, i do, i do, i need your help, but chandler i don’t know if i can take anymore"
chandler,"oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera and my gentle self-loathing touch."
monica,"""take me to the mansion in the sky-y"". i am sorry, the song is over. did you see me out there?"
phoebe,every little bit of you!
monica,"i can’t believe i did this. i can’t believe i'm singing for the people, and they liked me! hey, did you hear that"
phoebe,"mon', not that you didn’t sound good, but..."
monica,good? didn’t you hear them...i was great! thank you so much for making me do this. that’s is the best gift ever.
ross,"but, what’s great is that you don’t mind talking about it."
ross,weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
phoebe,"as a matter of fact she said that's how i am going to die. (pause ) so, excuse me for being a little skittish."
chandler,"(looking at the answering machine) hey, there's two messages. these could be from work!"
monica,"oh, play them!"
chandler,"ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)"
phoebe,"well, i bet that was very hard for him to do."
chandler,this is..shhh!
monica,"oh god, i am so sorry honey..."
chandler,"whoa-ho, back off, missy! (he takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)"
chandler,i don't know; i'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (she lets go of his tie) wait a minute... am i sexy in oklahoma?
chandler,"(flattered) no,... no... (realizing) no! (he quickly gets several steps away from her.) look, i'm, i'm married!"
chandler,i'm *happily* married.
chandler,"right. so, i'm sorry..."
chandler,"well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. she's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... you know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. but, what i have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us."
chandler,"i mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!"
monica,can you hear me say you're grounded?
chandler,you said that to me last week.
monica,how hard is it? no shoes on the furniture!
joey,argh. the producer from days of our life left me a message on the machine asking why i wasn't at the parade! they say everybody is very pissed off at me and they all got to meet santa! [whining]
phoebe,"it's ok. i thought of the perfect lie for you. it's easy to remember and it doesn't invite alot of questions. you weren't at the parade, because you had a family emergency."
joey,oh...i like that! yeah! i wasn't at the parade because i had a family emergency.
phoebe,ooo...what happened?
joey,er...my sister's raccoon came.....
monica,wha...wait what are you doing?
joey,setting the table.
phoebe,i know but he call's and my heart goes to him. you know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
phoebe,oh.
phoebe,ok i can't do this.
phoebe,"well there is no vicrum, ross made him up because i never really have been in a long-term relationship, i've never lived with a guy, and i've never even celebrated an anniversary so… (pause) if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave i totally understand. in fact i'll close my eye's make it less awkward (she sits with her eyes closed and mike kisses her, phoebe opens her eyes and like a little child says…) you kissed me."
phoebe,so you don't think i'm a total freak
phoebe,"i guess so, can i… can i think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and phoebe pulls back) and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers."
ross,(t
monica,i'm sorry...
phoebe,i'm sorry too... (they hug)
monica,ooohh... hey! wanna stick around and i'll whip you up some dinner?
phoebe,yeah! as long as it's free! food here is ridiculously over-p...
phoebe,"(smiling, raising her hand) who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?"
rachel,hey!
joey,hey!
rachel,"joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?"
joey,(touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) oh man! i thought i got it all!
rachel,(looks puzzled) how...how...?
joey,"i was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?"
rachel,yeah! (to sandy) excuse me... (she walks to the kitchen with ross and sighs)
ross,do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? huh? i haven't cried that many times since i moved in.
rachel,"look, ross, he's just... sandy is just sensitive, that's all."
ross,"(picks up a cookie) okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. he is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)"
rachel,what...? too sensitive to take care of our baby?
ross,"(speaking with his mouth full) yeah, i mean, all things that guy... (looks at the cookie) these are amazing!"
rachel,sandy made madeleines.
ross,"this... this is exactly what i'm talking about. what kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate french cookies, huh? they're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a careful bite from the cookie)"
rachel,"well, i... you know, i-i-i don't know what to say... i mean, i never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. you know, 'cause i gotta tell you ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle."
chandler,"that was a celebration of life. alright, look, i'm not gonna do this. alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?"
monica,"no, you're right. mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. huch. for what it's worth, i'm, i'm sorry. i shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. so you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world."
chandler,mean it?
monica,yah.
chandler,"you are incredible. unless, i...i'm not gonna smoke again. and if i do, i promise, i will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)"
monica,d'you want to?
chandler,"yeah, let's celebrate life!"
monica,'kay.
rachel,"och, god. (seeing emma) oh, thank god, you're okay. i'm so sorry we left you. mom never gonna leave you again. never ever ever again. uch."
rachel,are you gonna... you're going to take hugsy away from a little child?
joey,how do you think i got him in the first place?
monica,"alright you two, i'm gonna go to the bathroom. now i don't want anything going on while i'm gone. here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and ross doing it."
phoebe,"i know, i want that too, but is that going to make it too hard?"
monica,"(running back into the room) kiss him, you fool!!"
phoebe,what?
monica,didn't you hear that speech? if you don't kiss him then i will!
phoebe,"oh, i missed you so much! (she kisses mike)"
phoebe,who is this?
monica,"hi, that's what i'm doing for phoebe!"
ross,hi!
rachel,"so you eh, you talked to joey?"
ross,"ah, yeah. we had a really good talk."
rachel,oh! that's great!
ross,yeah!
rachel,"oh, so everything's okay?"
ross,"oh, no, it's great. it's great. he is... he is an amazing guy."
rachel,"ah... well, obviously i think so too."
ross,"well, i'm so excited about this."
rachel,really? excited?
ross,are you kidding? i have had some very dirty dreams about this...
rachel,"excuse me! (and she walks back to joey, who is still looking very impressed about what ross said to him. rachel looks at him and hits him.) you didn't tell him, did you?"
joey,i couldn't. he was saying all these really nice things about me. i didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. i'm on a edge on chandler.
rachel,"oh my god! ross!! ross is gonna pick up the phone! ah, i have to get my number back! oh my god! he’s gone!"
phoebe,"[as rachel] “ah, i have to get my number back!”, “oh my god! he’s gone!” dead on!"
ross,so soon?
ross,"okay. thanks, er, for the beer."
ross,"ah, yeah, good times."
ross,ohh. [relieved that mike has gone]
phoebe,"hey mike, it’s me. listen: is ross near you?"
phoebe,"well, you have to go back in."
chandler,your ass?!?!?
rachel,"man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!"
chandler,they...do that?
monica,it's kind of a package deal!
chandler,god why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
monica,i thought i was something that we both wanted!
chandler,"alright look...if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. but the giant ass and the big clown feet?"
rachel,"oh my god chandler! if you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? with the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?"
chandler,what?
rachel,joey! why did you tell chandler that monica was getting a boob job?
monica,"that's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so)."
joey,monica!
monica,"don't worry joe, i won't come next year!"
joey,(to rachel) what have you got there?
ross,just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
joey,"ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) damn, that's a lot of guys! are you a little slutty?"
rachel,(drunken voice) i think i am.
joey,"(browsing the tissues) let me see if i approve any of these clowns. this guy wears a rug (discards one). this guy's canadian (discards another). and this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and i don't feel any different."
joey,"(discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass..."
rachel,"(picking up the tissues) why, why, what's wrong with these guys?"
joey,"nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best."
rachel,"joey, you're so sweet."
joey,"that's true. but you know what, it doesn't matter because i already know who you're gonna go home with tonight."
chandler,i think we've found our sperm!
monica,does seem pretty perfect.
chandler,"yeah, you think so, well? should i ask him?"
monica,(pause) no.
chandler,"why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!"
monica,"no, that's not it. it's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, i just... i just realized i don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you."
chandler,"yeah, he's better!"
monica,"no, he's not. and if i can't get pregnant with you, then i don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else."
chandler,really? are you sure?
monica,"yeah, i'm sure."
chandler,"(sighs with relief) thank god, because i don't wanna do this either. you know, i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do. you know, i'm the husband, i'm supposed to... bring the sperm."
chandler,actually it's both of us.
monica,what?
chandler,apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
monica,oh... what does that mean?
chandler,it means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) it means...
monica,chandler?
chandler,"(seriously) it means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us."
monica,(weeping) oh my god!
chandler,i'm sorry.
monica,i'm sorry too.
chandler,"well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out."
rachel,why would you do that?
rachel,that's really nice.
rachel,"then you're not gonna like what's coming. (starts crying) i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. thank you, thank you."
joey,please don't fire my friend. just let me talk to her.
joey,"thank you, thank you. how about i do something for you? tomorrow, i'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?"
joey,"hey, listen pheebs. i was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit drake, you just wait on the tables?"
phoebe,i can't do that. i'm an actor. i have a process.
joey,you're a masseuse. you have a table with a hole in it.
phoebe,"wait a minute, i see what's happening here. you're threatened."
joey,what?
phoebe,"yeah, i'm so good in this scene that i'm stealing focus from you. well, rise to the challenge tribianni 'cause i just raised the bar. come join me up here!"
monica,"this is monica! i'm phoebe's friend. listen, phoebe is back with david and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say ""yes"" but i know she really wants to be with you!"
monica,"i... i'm sorry, did you say something? i can't hear through all this damned hair! (tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, in vain)"
monica,"you don't tell me what to do! i tell you what to do! just call her. she's at the paradise hotel in barbados. and while i've got you, you've got curly hair. what do you do in humidity? (mike hangs up the phone) damnit!"
monica,"(sarcastically) well, i hope you're happy!"
chandler,"(pretending not to sense the tone) oooh! i hope you're happy too, honey!"
monica,"phoebe is going to say ""yes"" to david. see, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!"
chandler,"phoebe is going to say ""yes""? that's, that's great!"
monica,"no it's not, b'cause she's still in love with mike!"
chandler,and there's not chance that will work?
monica,"no, i called him. it's not gonna happen."
chandler,(pointing at her) oooooooh! meddler! meddler!
joey,i didn’t go to college.
joey,molly…people don’t study acting…
ross,molly…er…do you mind giving us just a minute?
joey,will the stable boy never get the princess?
ross,"so, what do you think you gonna do? huh? have sex with her right here on my couch?"
joey,"no. the leather sticks to my ass. you know, this isn’t fair. what make you think that i’m just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? huh? can’t you guy open your mind to the possibilities that i actually like her? and i might want something real? (ross and chandler remain silent) .the truth is, i haven’t felt this way about anyone since rachel. ok. i didn’t think i could ever love again."
ross,"er, yea yeah. come on in. molly."
ross,oh ok.
ross,uh-ah!
ross,(pfew). good choice ross.
rachel,"oh, hey! hi, there you are, i’ve been looking for you everywhere!"
ross,"oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here i am."
rachel,"listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o’ clock. so i was hoping you and i could have a"
ross,"oh, yeah, yeah that’s michelle."
rachel,who?
ross,"oh, just this woman i’ve been seeing."
rachel,you’ve being seeing someone?
rachel,"oh, it is so unfair. it's like that time they promoted sandra over me at work."
chandler,"oh, is she related to ralph lauren?"
rachel,"no, she was just much better at job than me!"
phoebe,"guys, the drawing is about to start!"
rachel,(to ross) you know what? we should call my mum's house and say goodnight to emma before she goes down.
ross,"oh yeah, it's a good idea!"
monica,really?
chandler,you kidding? you're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (she jumps up and kisses him.) (breaking the kiss.) whoa! whoa! whoa! what's going on? you and i just made out! you and i are making out?
monica,"well, not anymore."
chandler,but we don't do that.
monica,"i know, i just thought it would be fun."
chandler,how drunk are you?
monica,drunk enough that i know i wanna do this. not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
chandler,(thinks) that's the perfect amount!
monica,okay!
monica,(breaking the kiss) y'know what's weird?
chandler,what?
phoebe,i thought it might be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
monica,oh..how nice! maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress
ross,"hey dude, you ok? sorry bout before."
chandler,"no, no that's ok. you're totally right i don't know anything about disciplining a child. but...you did hurt my feelings...so, i want you to know that if i die, you don't get joey."
rachel,"oh yeah...yeah, right. remember in high school, when i died, and didn't give you my baby?"
rachel,you decorate dad's office and now you're a decorator? ok! i went to the zoo yesterday...now i'm a koala bear!
rachel,suppor...you wanna talk supportive? you didn't even come and visit me when i was in the hospital having the baby!
rachel,i did the first time!
rachel,and...and you know what? you wanna know why i'm not giving emily to you?
rachel,uh-huh
joey,"and i couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and i thought...well... how important can that be, right...? turns out very!"
rachel,(to herself) wow...definitely just drake...
joey,what?
rachel,what...how is it going with drake?
joey,oh...i don't think it's going very well...
rachel,what...that scene i saw was so good!
joey,"well, i'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow..."
rachel,"joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so i'll give you a compliment?"
joey,"a little. yeah no, i really am worried, you know, i mean i have to make it convincing that i'm in love with olivia."
ross,hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
rachel,"okay, what? what is too sensitive? (there's music coming from the living room. ross opens the door to the living room and he and rachel see sandy play a song for emma on his recorder. rachel is moved by this, but ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the kitchen, angrily. the door he was holding, swings back and hits rachel.)"
phoebe,"hmmm... no, no... no, i can't do this. it's bad."
phoebe,"no, no. no."
phoebe,"look david, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and i-i'm with mike and i really care about him..."
phoebe,(points to david) and you thanks for the face massage. thank you.
ross,did rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
ross,great. so let's get going?
rachel,"oh no. i mean it. after what just happened, i'm never leaving her again."
ross,somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
chandler,uhh. you are welcome.
monica,you know what? let's not talk.
chandler,what?
monica,uch. i am still so mad at you for smoking.
chandler,but you said you forgave me. it was just a couple of cigarettes--no big deal.
monica,"oh, blablablabaybaybay."
chandler,leave it.
monica,i was just saying that because i was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting.
chandler,you tricked me to get me into bed?
monica,excuse me?
monica,"hey, at least i knew where my guy was."
monica,you didn't hear the speech!
monica,"hey, it was very moving! you're just heartless!"
monica,you're... weird!
monica,oh (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)!
monica,damn it!
monica,and i blame you too.
ross,"it's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! i tell you, when i actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!"
rachel,"oh god! alright, fine. you know what joey, forget it. when we go back to new york, i will tell him."
joey,"thank you. yeah, i appreciate that."
phoebe,"hi, mike's place."
phoebe,"ooh, that was fast."
phoebe,"yeah, you can't do that! oh, come on mike, strap on a pair.why don't you just tell her that we got back together. you know, women appreciate honesty. we also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. just f.y.i."
phoebe,her name is precious? is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
phoebe,"okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)"
phoebe,(stunned) i... i'm phoebe.
phoebe,"enchanté (she holds out her hand, and they shake hands)"
phoebe,"i’m so sorry, honey, but, okay. rachel gave this guy her number, and, erm, she does not want ross to answer the phone, so you have to intercept all of his calls."
phoebe,[to rachel] he says that he can’t do that
rachel,"oh, give me. [rachel takes the phone of phoebe] hi, mike! hi, listen, i know this is a lot to ask, but you know what. if you do this, ah, phoebe will do anything you want. seriously, i’m talking dirty stuff."
phoebe,"alright, give it here. [phoebe takes the phone] hello? i'm sorry about her, but, she wasn’t wrong about the dirty stuff."
phoebe,"oh, oh, mike! bye. [hangs up]"
ross,hi!
ross,w-why? [blocking route of entry]
ross,"[exasperated] but, you left!"
joey,because she is!
monica,"joey, chandler knows i borrowed the money."
joey,mmmm hmm! for your boob job!
joey,ok so i'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
ross,hey! what do you guys think about this. ross. the divorce-force.
phoebe,better..
ross,hey phoebs...you know i'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and i hope i was a little helpful.
phoebe,"oh yeah you were helpful! yeah...no, thanks you."
ross,"good, good. yeah coz the more i thought about it, the more i realised i don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you."
phoebe,what do you mean?
ross,"well, i know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but...is that really you? i mean can you honestly picture yourself in a volvo?"
rachel,who (looks around)?
joey,me.
rachel,(surprised) what? (with a nervous smile) really?
joey,"yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!"
rachel,"oh! screw it, i didn't get it! (they high-five)"
joey,gotcha.
rachel,"oh, very funny... joey."
chandler,"(to monica) so, how did you enjoy the play?"
monica,"oh my god, honey, i'm so so so so so sorry."
chandler,well you should be. you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
monica,that is so sweet. i love you. (they kiss)
chandler,so you know this leaves us with...
monica,adoption.
chandler,how do you feel about that?
monica,i think i feel ok about it. actually i think i feel really good about it.
chandler,me too. i wanna find a baby that needs a home and i wanna raise it with you. and i wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
monica,"so this is it, we're really gonna adopt?"
chandler,(smiling) yeah.
monica,"(excitedly) oh my god, we're gonna be parents!"
chandler,we are gonna be great parents.
monica,"and it could be soon. i mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there (they go look through the window) our baby could be being conceived."
monica,(still weeping) i know.
phoebe,(imitating the receptionist's tone) good morning receptionist.
phoebe,"rachel green? (angrily) son of a bitch, she came back?"
phoebe,"(through the door, with a scottish accent) are you ready for your scottish massage? put your face in the hole, lassy."
joey,"(to the director) yeah, you can fire her, but i would call security, she won't go easy."
monica,you faked it? you couldn't have faked it!
chandler,oh yes you can. you just make the faces and the noises.
monica,"guys can fake it? unbelievable. the one thing that's ours! besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?"
chandler,"that's actually why. look, i'm starting a whole new career now, and i'm not saying that i don't want to have a baby, i'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while."
monica,like a month?
chandler,or a year?
monica,"really, you want to wait a year?"
chandler,"it could be less than a year. i mean, you've heard my stuff. ""pants. like shorts, but longer."" (pause) it'll probably be more than a year."
monica,"well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, i wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!"
chandler,this vacation sucks!!
joey,"i'm so bored! stupid rain, we... we can't do anything."
rachel,"well, i've brought some books. we could read."
joey,"hey, it hasn't come to that yet."
joey,(stopping the waiter) hey hey hey! don't mind if i do!
joey,"hey rach, do you feel like going to a convention?"
rachel,we can't. we're not pharmacists!
joey,"(walking to a table with many badges on it) i know we're not, but (he picks up a badge) frank medeio and... (picks up another badge) eva trorro... womba..."
rachel,(picking up another random badge) kate miller?
joey,kate miller it is. (he picks up the kate miller badge and sticks it on rachel's breast)
rachel,and... that's the most sex i'm gonna have this weekend.
ross,"er…well, joey, i guess, we have no problem."
joey,"it’s like my favourite fairytale come true. the princess, the stable boy and the lesbian."
phoebe,"okay, you start preparing the formula and i will start changing the box. and then we got to put them straight to bed."
phoebe,"well, you know what? there are responsibility now."
phoebe,mate? they are all brothers and sisters.
phoebe,"no. really? (she opened the box)oh my god, get off your sister."
phoebe,"oh my god, where are we gonna do? then, we have seven rats.(mike nods) so what if each of them has seven rats? and each of those has seven rats? that’s like… (counting her fingers) that’s maths i cant even do. what are we gonna do?"
ross,"yeah, didn’t i mention that? yeah, i mean, we haven’t being going out for too long, but rather there is this"
ross,"how great is this? you are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. oh, i am sorry michelle, that’s"
rachel,"hi, and i am also emma’s mother."
ross,i told you about my daughter.
chandler,and done!
joey,"oh my god! i didn’t feel a thing ! hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around"
chandler,thanks. you wanna see what it looks like?
joey,"yeah, yeah. hey, they totally match! they look great! they look great! how you doing!"
monica,"(she hugs chandler) honey, you've been really strong about this, i know how badly you wanted that job."
chandler,"yeah, you know, i really thought i deserved it. (pause) but... let's go win the lottery... i mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?"
monica,(she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants) 131! (they kiss)
ross,"(on the phone) goodnight sweetheart! i love you. and remember, you're daddy's little girl... (covering the phone, to rachel) phoebe's totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver to rachel)"
rachel,"hi mum, put her back on!"
joey,"(sitting on the sofa in front of the tv) rach, come on! they are announcing the numbers! my god, i can already feel myself changing."
chandler,i got that!
ross,"oh, we have one too!!"
monica,"we are on a roll, people!!"
monica,this doesn't feel weird!
chandler,i know.
monica,you're a really good kisser.
chandler,"well, i have kissed over four women. (they kiss again.) do you wanna get under the covers?"
monica,hm-hmm!
chandler,okay!
monica,wow! you are really fast!
chandler,it bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
monica,we're gonna see each other naked.
chandler,yep!
monica,do you wanna do it at the same time?
ross,emma.
rachel,"oh! whoose side are you on!/ i'm not giving you emma because there is no way, you could handle the responsibility of a child."
joey,"ooooooooohoohooo.......[realizes it is the wrong time and looks away, at his shoes.]"
rachel,jealous of what? of your lack of responsibility? your...your inmaturity? your total disregard for other people's feelings?
rachel,timmy was my boyfriend! and you made out with him!!
rachel,oh god! i cannot believe...i cannot believe that i invited you here today!
rachel,so?
joey,so...i've never played that!
rachel,"ooh! honey, it can't be that hard, i mean, you've been in love before?"
joey,uh...well...just once...with you...
rachel,ok...this could be a little awkward...i'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
joey,(looks at her for a moment) what the hell are you talking about??
rachel,"(shakes her head) alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene."
joey,"(approvingly) oh! ok, yeah, i think i can do that. yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so i would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me."
rachel,"(looks touched) joey, you never..you never talked about that before..."
joey,"well.. hey, you know what else i could use? there's a scene where drake sneaks into olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! and he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (in a romantic voice) and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when i would think to myself, my god, she...is... beautiful... (rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz i knew i could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you."
monica,yeah! i think that's great!
ross,"oh really? did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes madeleines?"
monica,oh... how are they?
ross,(looks like in heaven) lighter than air... (changes back to serious) but that's not the point. (joey now also enters)
joey,hey!
ross,hey...! rachel and i hired a male nanny.
joey,(looks surprised) really...? guys do that...? that's... weird...
ross,thank you!
joey,that's like a woman wanting to be a...
ross,...a what? a what? what's the end of that sentence?
monica,yes... what is the end of that sentence?
joey,"uhm... a penis model. (monica can't believe what's she's hearing and ross pats joey on the back.) anyway, hey... did you tell chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?"
monica,"that's right, i got mine."
chandler,i feel so used.
phoebe,"well, i guess they're not coming. you wanna just order?"
joey,"thank you. (stands up and kisses her lips.) waiter! 'lright, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep uphoebe: risotto with the shaped truffels and the roasted rip steak with the golden chanderelles and a bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff i just said means snails. (hope, *i* kept up.)"
phoebe,tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
phoebe,"both it is, thank you."
joey,"oh, uh, again. can i make a special request: can you bring everything as soon as it's ready? appetizers, entrees, we don't care."
phoebe,you guys are over an hour late. what happened to you two?
ross,i'm so sorry ...
rachel,"we got locked out of the apartment, we ..."
chandler,there you go! someone came!
ross,"ok, ok! i'm gonna go hide! oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)"
monica,"hi, glad you could come."
chandler,"(in a mournful voice) please, come in."
chandler,"oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat."
chandler,at least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)
ross,who is he?
chandler,"some guy, tom gordon."
ross,"i don't remember him, but then again i touched so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)"
monica,"so, did you know ross well?"
monica,"(a bit surprised) yes, he is. me."
chandler,"(entering, very upset) ok tommy, that's enough mourning for you! here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)"
monica,"oh, i can't wait for everyone at work to see these... (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) ow!"
chandler,"you go back to work tomorrow night, right?"
monica,yeah!
chandler,"so if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?"
monica,"well, if i had them taken out, then i wouldn't be able to do this. (she pushes chandler on the couch and brushes her hair and shells against chandler's chest) you like that, right? (again, she brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)"
chandler,what are you singing?
monica,"it's ""bolero"" from ""10""."
chandler,"it's ""ride of the valkyries"" from ""apocalypse now""... see, here's the thing: the corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. and now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... i hate them!"
monica,you what? you said you liked them.
chandler,did i? let's refresh. i believe what i said was that i could see your scalp.
monica,"fine, so you don't like them. everybody else does."
chandler,"again, let's journey back... as i recall what rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. and joey... well, joey didn't realise that there was anything different."
joey,"wow, that didn’t take long. i thought you said tulsa was a three-hour flight?"
chandler,"well,… you’re forgetting about the time difference."
monica,"huh, chandler – you’re home!"
chandler,"that’s right. your husband’s home, so now the sex can stop."
monica,what are you saying?
chandler,joey said that you’re in here with another man!
monica,there's no man in here! how dare you accuse me of that? [slaps chandler]
joey,"alright, alright. then maybe you won’t mind if me and my friend takes a look around then. huh! where you at?"
chandler,what’s he doing?
monica,i arranged some pillows on the bed to make it look like a guy!
phoebe,they are awfully boxy...
ross,i don't know...you'd be so bored with marriage. i mean it's so...normal.
phoebe,uh huh.
ross,"hey hey, can i help?"
chandler,"well! we er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul...but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky."
ross,"you know sometimes your words, they hurt."
joey,hey eh..where do you guys want this?
rachel,"yeah..seriously coz this is really heavy. (she suddenly lets go) i mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys."
phoebe,just one last time erm...the marriage thing...there's no wiggle room? none at all?
phoebe,right. except that i do want to get married.
phoebe,someday.
monica,you really liked it?
chandler,"oh yeah! i mean at first i hated it, but why wouldn't i, because as a man i've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) but after chapter 16: ""fat, single and ready to mingle"", i was uplifted."
monica,oh really!
chandler,"oh yeah, i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! tell me, tell me about your first period!"
monica,no!
chandler,did somebody sign your bra?
monica,so i got it when i was 13...
phoebe,"hey ross! so listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of nobel prizes scare you off? what is that, come on, a piece of paper?"
ross,"it's actually a 1,000,000$ prize."
phoebe,"go charlie! but my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average joe phd."
ross,"yeah, maybe. i do have my whole career in front of me. i mean, i can still win a nobel prize. although the last two papers i've written were widely discredited."
phoebe,"you're so much more than just brains! you're sweet, and kind, and funny..."
ross,and sexy.
chandler,"wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!"
chandler,"hey, zack!"
chandler,"look, i just wanted to apologize for last night. i got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable."
chandler,really?
chandler,"my wife and i have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. we're working on it."
chandler,"you wouldn't know if jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?"
monica,"i really wanna have a baby. chandler: yeah, me too. look, i'll just get my old job back."
monica,"no, i want you to have a job that you love. not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration."
chandler,i quit and you learn what i do?
monica,"it's just, i think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. i mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. there's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but i think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons."
joey,"in that case should i make sure it's on real good? (he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it)"
rachel,thank you. (they walk away)
ross,"yeah, that's it?"
ross,"oh my god, we did it! (he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly)"
ross,"yes, but i did make a pyramid out of the bath products. this is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. (he leans in, and they look at each other for a moment) that's a pretty necklace."
ross,"hey, what do you say we celebrate? champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)"
ross,"oh my god, i love you."
phoebe,"yeah, okay. i guess you are right. alright, so we’ll just give them away. but to nice families. with children. and reduced-fat wheatbuns. those are bob's favourties."
phoebe,you think i’m crazy?
phoebe,"good. it’s just so hard. it’s hard for me to let them go. i guess it’ll just bring back memories, you know, from, when i gave birth to my brother’s triplets and i have to give them up."
phoebe,"i haven’t told you about that yet, have i?"
monica,hey
rachel,hi. thanks for the party honey. so i help you clean up?
monica,"no way. you had your party, now i have mine."
monica,is everything alright?
chandler,"yeah, yeah, i think it looks pretty good. i was a little worried i was uncovering a birthmark right about"
joey,thank you so much.
chandler,no problem.
joey,"listen that’s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it."
chandler,yeah.
joey,comb my eyelashes.
monica,"ok, for my next song i think i’ll sing something a little more upbeat. all right? oh, how about the pointer"
phoebe,oh you’ll probably take care of that on your hands.
chandler,i am sorry i am late. you’ll understand when you’ll see joey.
ross,(calling rachel) come on!!
rachel,"(on the phone) mum, please!i know you love your new lips, but i can barely understand you! would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?"
monica,check your numbers! make me rich!
rachel,"(she goes towards the others and she's very excited) guys, you're not gonna believe this! i was just saying goodnight to emma and she said her first words!!"
joey,and what did she say?
chandler,count of three?
monica,one!
chandler,two!
monica,two!
chandler,well i think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
monica,"eh, we weren't that close anyway!"
chandler,eh! (they start making out again)
chandler,"so, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
rachel,hahah......ahhahah...it's forty-five!
ross,too far amy. too far.
rachel,you take that back.
rachel,take it back!
rachel,hey...man! i work out!
rachel,i do karates.
rachel,bring it on!
joey,(excited) thanks dude!!!this is great!! (leaves rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)
chandler,i got you something from vermont! (sits down at the table)
monica,(without looking up from what she's doing) besides tampons and salt? (then looks) ooh! my god! maple candy! that's so sweet of you. (opens the box) that's weird...it's empty!
ross,"(sounds excited) hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?"
monica,"yeah, so?"
ross,wow!
joey,really? do you not know chandler?
monica,"is that why he's acting so weird...? he's jealous...? oh my god, that is crazy. it's not like i'm attracted to geoffrey..."
joey,"so what? being funny is chandler's thing... you know, like ross's thing is... (he can't come up with anything)"
ross,science...? academia...? being a good father...?
joey,...no... (he just can't seem to grasp it)
monica,i can't believe he's that upset about this...
joey,that's a great story--can i eat it?
ross,and then rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
rachel,"n-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and i did what i got to do."
phoebe,and that's judy over there at the bar with emma?
rachel,"oh honey, this is for the best, thus i'm not distracted, worrying about emma, how she's doing at home and i'm being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!"
ross,what?
rachel,"she spit up. judy! she spi...judy! look alive, judy! (they sit down) thank you."
chandler,ok! (shuts the door behind tom)
ross,(coming in) i'm dead and no one cares?
monica,i look like a man??
chandler,"please, one ridiculous problem at a time!"
ross,"it isn't ridiculous, look around! no one's here!"
chandler,"you gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and monica... it's probably the way you stand!"
ross,"yes, you're right. still somebody must have seen it... i mean, i went to that school for 4 years, i didn't have an impact on anyone?"
chandler,"oh, that's not true. you had an impact on me, i mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. doesn't that count for something?"
monica,"you know what? i don't care. i like it like this, and i'm gonna keep it. you're just jealous because your hair can't do this... (and she shakes her head more violently) ouch!"
chandler,hit yourself in the tooth?
monica,and the eye!
ross,"(gasps) hi... there she is. hi emma. oh my god, i missed you. (kisses her) oh emma, i missed you so much. hey... did you have a good time with grandma green? huh? did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? (to rachel)"
rachel,"that was one time, ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams."
ross,"ooh hey, emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? okay? i want you to wait right here. come here sweetie."
rachel,"aaah... ross, actually there's something that i really need to talk to you about."
ross,"(unpacking his bag) okay, shoot!"
rachel,"okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal."
joey,"bedroom’s clear, although you might need some new pillows."
chandler,"alright, well, i’ll check the guest bedroom."
joey,why do i smell men’s cologne?
monica,i think that's you.
joey,"oh yeah, i rubbed a magazine on myself earlier."
chandler,"nobody here, joe."
joey,i guess not.
monica,i can’t believe you thought i was cheating. you owe me an apology.
chandler,aaaaand.......hernia.
phoebe,i haven't exactly had a normal life and i never really felt i was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.
phoebe,"because i just didn't know how much i wanted it. and i love you, and i wanted to live with you."
phoebe,"but i don't think i can! it was ok to move in when i didn't know what was gonna happen, but i can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen."
phoebe,are you gonna change yours?
phoebe,me neither. i think i need to be with someone who wants what i want.
phoebe,ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
ross,"yeah, you're right, thanks pheebs, i'm gonna go find her."
phoebe,"good for you! and hey, i thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the devonian era was top notch!"
ross,stop going through my stuff (walks away)!
rachel,(to monica) hey!
monica,hey!
rachel,"i just wanted to let you know i've changed my mind: i'm gonna do it, i'm gonna kiss joey."
monica,"no, you can't! friends hooking up is a bad idea."
rachel,"please, what about you and chandler?"
monica,that's different! i was drunk and stupid!
rachel,well hello (points to herself)!
monica,what about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? why don't you just kiss one of them?
chandler,i guess. it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
monica,"it's gonna be really scary. i mean, god. when we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. i mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, i won't have time to clean it. what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? messes up all the ribbons?! what if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? where will all the ribbons go!?!"
chandler,should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
monica,"yes, please!"
chandler,"oh, and i promise, i will not fake it this time."
monica,i wish i could say the same. i'm a little shook up!
ross,"that's ben, my son from my first marriage."
ross,yeah.
ross,no. (they clink glasses and drink)
ross,"(embarassed) oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? she... she was... eh... gay."
ross,"ok, odd thing to get excited about!"
ross,hey! high-five! (they high-five)
ross,my wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. she didn't get any fitter.
rachel,yah. i just feel a little bummed that my birthday is over.
monica,"well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. that jerk gavin from your office didn’t show up."
rachel,yahh(nodding)
monica,we weren’t talking about you. nope. no way to recover. (she goes back inside)
rachel,"well, it was. and you would have seen it if you didn’t show up at (rachel lifts gavin’s hand to see the time) nine thirty! oh god! this party was lame!"
monica,"again, you’re welcome."
rachel,"oh, you brought me a present. why?"
rachel,"oh, well okay. well that’s very nice. and you wrote a card. (she reads the card) from gavin."
monica,"honey, you’re just in time, i’m about to sing another song!"
chandler,really? in front of all this people?
monica,and they love me!
chandler,oh my god!
phoebe,"yes, she gives the people what they want."
monica,"all right, watch!"
monica,"""tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. give in this"
chandler,are those my wife’s nipples?
phoebe,"oh? isn’t that funny? i didn't see that before, i wouldn't have let her go up again."
chandler,i gotta stop this.
monica,"oh, who cares, they still love me! ""i am so excited..."""
chandler,"you, touching yourself, out!"
rachel,wow. she does that a lot!
rachel,"what, what, wait a minute! you haven’t even told her you were a doctor, yet? how long have you known her, like"
rachel,"she said ""gleba""!! (she celebrates)"
monica,make me rich!!
rachel,(to ross) isn't that amazing?
ross,"oh yeah, no no no...that's great!"
rachel,why-why aren't you more excited?
ross,"oh, rach...oh...""gleba"" is not a word."
rachel,"oh, but of course it is!"
ross,"okay, what does it mean?"
rachel,i don't know all the words.
ross,"i'm just, i'm just glad i didn't miss my daughter's first words (goes back to checking the tickets)."
ross,"yes you did, gleba is a word!"
ross,"ok, use it in a sentence."
monica,"well uh, you and i are just goofing around, i thought, why not just goof around with him."
chandler,"y'know, i don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am *so* bad at this."
monica,i think you're better than you think you are.
chandler,"really? okay, so..."
monica,(interrupting) know when to stop.
chandler,"y'know, i sensed that i should stop. so we're okay?"
monica,"yeah. (they kiss and as she starts to leave, chandler starts to dance. without turning around:) don't do the dance."
chandler,right!
monica,"i can't get married until i get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue."
chandler,"okay, all right, all right, all right! okay! (picks up a blue sweater.) okay, here's something, here's something blue and new."
monica,you're so efficient. i love you!
monica,put the plates back in the boxes! put the plates back in the boxes!
rachel,did you just push me?
rachel,alright that's it!
monica,forget the bubble wrap! there isn't time!
rachel,crazy crazy crazy crazy! [she says this while messing up amy's hair]
phoebe,oh my god! shouldn't we stop this?
joey,what are you? out of your mind? let's toss some jell-o on them!
rachel,ew! ew! gross gross!
chandler,"alright! that is it! this is our apartment and you cannot behave this way. now if you can't act your age, then you shouldn't be here at all. now, those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones i picked out...but they're very important to monica...and i want you to apologize to her right now."
rachel,mon...i'm so sorry.
chandler,"ok...that's better. now i want you to apologize to each other, and mean it."
ross,"dude, well done! you know what? if i die, and rachel dies, and monica dies, you can totally take care of emma."
joey,"monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and chandler walks in with a pizza)"
chandler,hey!
joey,heeeyy! hey!
chandler,what are you guys talking about?
ross,"uhm... rachel and i hired a male nanny. (joey makes a gesture and sound like ""can you believe that?"")"
chandler,"you got a man who's a nanny...? you got a manny...? (monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. joey realises they also should laugh and punches ross. now all three of them laugh, but very fake. chandler seems happy again.)"
chandler,"you know, i don't mind a... male nanny, but i do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)"
monica,"ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!"
chandler,"if i'd known you guys were coming over, i would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)"
monica,"okay, okay... chandler you... you stop it! (monica wipes away tears)"
chandler,what is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke)
ross,thanks. oh.
rachel,"oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. what should i ha-ave? what should i have?"
joey,(mumbling) never hit a woman. never hit a woman.
ross,y'know this ??? is incredible.
joey,ross bruises like a peach. he bruises like a peach.
ross,"okay, i'll have the fixed salad and the duck."
rachel,"yah, i'll have the soup and the salmon."
joey,"and remember whatever comes up first. okay? and hurry, because .."
monica,(entering with husband) happy birthday!
joey,son of a bitch!
ross,(sceptical) yeah...
chandler,"i'm sure it's somebody for you. now, go hide. (ross hides in the bedroom again)"
chandler,kori? kori weston?
chandler,wow! you look amazing!
chandler,"chandler, chandler bing. i'm not gay, i'm not gay at all."
monica,you are married though.
chandler,"don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)"
chandler,i didn't know ross and you were so close.
chandler,"i'm sure that would mean a lot to him. and if heaven has a door, i'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."
ross,(gasps) oh no!
rachel,what? what is it?
ross,"oh, major shampoo explosion!"
rachel,"uh, look ross, this really isn't easy."
ross,"oh, it's all over everything. why? why me? (looks up)"
rachel,because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
ross,"i'm sorry, i'm sorry. you were saying?"
rachel,"well, yeah... okay, look it's about me and..."
ross,"oh, not another one! oh my g... and this is moisturiser. it's even harder to clean! why? why do bad things happen to good people?"
rachel,"wow! well, clearly this is not a good time."
ross,"duh, you think? (enters the kitchen)"
phoebe,"okay, bye. alright, so mike's on his way over. see, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. point is... i'm gonna take off."
joey,"you’re right, monica. i’m so sorry."
monica,"it’s an honest mistake. it can happen to anybody. alright, see ya."
joey,"wait, wait, wait a minute. if you’ve just got back from tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?"
chandler,"i climb down the fire escape, and you can’t put that in the closet?"
ross,[looking bored] maybe you should look up fascinating.
ross,i don’t understand what just happened here.
joey,what’s going on?
phoebe,i don't want it to end either.
phoebe,yeah.
rachel,i'm so sorry phoebs...
monica,we're all sorry...(they hug)
chandler,ah...look on the bright side...i mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! that was here already huh? i love you...(they hug again)
joey,"ah hah! i did it! ha ha! alright...(he takes a box out, about to close fridge, then thinks.) better take all i can carry...who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!"
rachel,"i could, i could but i don't want to! i want to kiss joey!"
monica,alright (shrugs). i think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
rachel,(pause) i'm gonna do it.
monica,and i can't stop you.
rachel,no.
ross,"(to rachel) hey rach, have you seen charlie anywhere?"
ross,i'm smarter than him!
phoebe,"hey, thank you so much for these tickets, chandler."
chandler,"oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and i wanted to share it with you."
monica,"oh, you're so wonderful."
ross,"i know! it's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? i mean, call, or leave a note: ""hi, i just dropped by to say your wife's gay"""
ross,"and then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?"
ross,(embarassed) me neither.
joey,"well, who knew? pharmacists are fun."
rachel,"i know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home."
joey,"not enough pills in the world, rach. what about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?"
rachel,"well, let's see. there was a really big guy that i was talking to, with the really nice breasts..."
joey,"but what about back home, anything going on there? anybody you like?"
rachel,"(takes a sip from her drink, embarassed) no."
joey,"there it is, you're blushing!"
rachel,oh that’s beautiful.
rachel,no.
rachel,"see, gavin. you are capable of being a nice guy. why did you give me such a hard time?"
rachel,well monica seems to think that it’s because you have feelings for me. s gavin: i do have feelings for you.
rachel,you do?
rachel,"see why? gavin, why? right about when i want to change my opinion of you, you go and (gavin pull her and kiss her). and you do that. (rachel initiates the kiss this time.)"
chandler,"“first i was afraid, i was petrified.” (he stops and laughs at himself.)"
ross,"i told you it wasn’t long, but there is an amazing connection between us."
ross,are you kidding?
ross,we’ll see.
rachel,"ok, ross, what’s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?"
ross,"i don’t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?"
rachel,how do you know about that?
ross,"through the magic of sight! i was here, putting our child to sleep..."
ross,"when i happened to look through the window and i see you kissing a guy you know, for what? a week?"
rachel,"oh, that’s what this is all about? did you bring her up here to get back at me?"
ross,"ok, michelle, it’s time to go."
rachel,"ok... ""emma just said gleba""!"
ross,it's not a word!
rachel,"okay, okay, okay, fine, i'm gonna look it up (she goes and picks up the dictionary)."
ross,"oh, oh, ok, great. you know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt...."
rachel,"(searching the dictionary) alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... (excited) gleba! ha! here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi."
ross,"she's gonna be a scientist! (kisses rachel on the head, very moved)"
chandler,let's go! (starts to leave.)
monica,"no-no-no, wait! we need something old!"
chandler,"oh, okay, i have condom in my wallet that i've had since i was twelve."
monica,that'll work!
chandler,i don't think so.
monica,"okay, now we just need something borrowed!"
chandler,(looks around) here just...take this. (hands her the sweater.)
monica,that's stealing!
chandler,"no, we'll-we'll bring it back! just put it under your dress."
chandler,"oh yeah? well, thanks!"
ross,"so, so, now do i get joey?"
chandler,"ok...but you should know, he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose."
rachel,are you ok mon?
monica,"uh huh. these things happen. i mean it's just a plate, it's not like somebody died."
phoebe,it's alright...you can mourn.
monica,i'm going to go to joey's and get pies.
monica,"well, i don't know... i-it's... just the way you say it... i mean, you're funny... you have that funny thing. you're a funny guy! (chandler turns to joey)"
chandler,"did you tell her what we talked about? (joey starts laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)"
joey,yeah....
chandler,so those were pity laughs? pity laughs? (joey and ross walk away from the kitchen)
monica,"honey, listen... you have nothing to worry about with geoffrey."
chandler,oh yeah? is he funnier than me?
phoebe,wher-where have you been?
monica,"well, we had a little fight."
chandler,i would never lie to get someone into bed.
monica,"you used to tell girls you were a kennedy. (being sat down) ooh, uh, thanks. wow, little tight, isn't it? how d'you get a bigger table? you-you had a big table, but they made you move. huh-huh, shut up monica. whoo, i suppose that chandler will have the smoked duck."
chandler,i suppose that monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.
joey,"why are you going? he said, she wanted the shrew! (runs after the waiter)"
ross,"rach, c'mon, emma is fine. you're turning into an obsessive mother. okay, you need to stop."
rachel,y'guys ever heard the story about when rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
chandler,you mean the lully story?
ross,"(childish) huh-huh, they already know it."
phoebe,"you guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order."
ross,"(he bounds into the lounge room) but you didn't! i'm still alive!! kori, i know this is a big surprise for you. it's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! i mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!"
ross,did you hear that? kori weston had a crush on me!!
ross,"(on the phone) no mum, i'm not dead. i know it's not something to kid about. it was just a practical joke between chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) actually no, even if i had died, you would not be left childless. (pause) monica?"
phoebe,"alright... susie, can i call you susie?"
phoebe,"yeah, i can't say that. uhm... susie, i'm gonna be straight with you... mike and i are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. and he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours."
phoebe,"well, i don't..."
phoebe,"nothing, there's nothing wrong with you."
phoebe,"damn it woman, pull yourself together! have some pride, for the love of god."
phoebe,"okay, not a fan of the tough love."
phoebe,"but he didn't really know, you know. he wasn't planning on coming to barbados and proposing to me..."
phoebe,"look, precious... mike's not worth this. you're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, mike's kind of a wang. i mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... he was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? and, i don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend."
chandler,i’m sorry. i told you that i was in tulsa because i wanted to spend the night with monica and i didn’t…didn’t know…didn’t think you’d understand.
joey,"what? you think i’m too dumb to know that a husband needs to be with his wife? uh? you think i’m like, duhhh! [taps head with baseball bat – it hurts him]"
monica,joey?
joey,yeah?
monica,i don’t know what to say. we shouldn’t have lied to you.
chandler,"can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away)."
rachel,"no, i'm not blushing, i'm sunburnt! from, you know, the rain."
joey,you like someone. tell me who it is. who is it? (tickles her a little)
rachel,no.
joey,tell me who it is.
rachel,joey! (she walks away; joey goes after her teasing and tickling her)
joey,"come on who? who do you like? tell me. you're not getting away that easy. who do you like, who?"
phoebe,hey
chandler,hey
phoebe,i think i left something here.
chandler,"oo, oh well, somebody left this."
chandler,is this yours?
phoebe,no but i like it (putting it on).no. i think i left one of my rat babies.
chandler,"oh, i haven’t seen it. but if i do, well i’ll let you know."
monica,"arrgggg, rat baby, rat baby, rat baby!!! (she runs onto the couch.)"
phoebe,oh may be that’s him.
ross,ok.
ross,"you know, if it’s meant to be, i’ll guess it. bye, bye."
rachel,score.
ross,"oh, i am sorry, did you not like her, because i was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on"
rachel,"oh god, i can’t believe you’re making such a big deal about this. it was one kiss, one guy, one time!"
ross,"oh, really!"
rachel,yeah.
ross,"oh, really!"
rachel,oh yeah.
joey,(checking the last ticket) damnit! anybody got anything?
chandler,no.
phoebe,i'm still looking through mine...
monica,"just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) no!"
monica,(answering phone) hello? hold on. it's your boss.
chandler,"ah, the ""i'm sorry i rejected you"" phone call. i'm not used to getting it from guys. (on the phone, getting up from the sofa) hey, steve."
chandler,"oh no no no no, i'd love to be somebody's assistant! answering phones, getting coffee, i live for that stuff! and i'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!"
chandler,"me, that guy who just said butt cracks?"
chandler,"ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. i'll see you tomorrow (hangs up)."
monica,ohh. (rubs her fake stomach.)
chandler,"okay, one thing at a time. (they run out to get married.)"
monica,"listen umm, i've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. i mean, you work, you work really hard for that."
chandler,ehh.
monica,"eh, you work for that."
chandler,"look, i thought about it too, and i'm sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding."
monica,you do?!
chandler,"yeah, i'm putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do."
monica,"oh, you're so sweet. (they hug and kiss.) oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?"
joey,"actually, not pies, it's just pie."
monica,"i don't care. oh my god, i've lost the will to scold."
rachel,"look, amy...i got a little out-of-control over there. erm...and i'm sorry. you're my sister and erm...if it really means that much to you..."
rachel,"no, i was going to let you use my ralph lauren discount."
rachel,she needs changing...
chandler,"oh no no! i'll get her. i'm super-confident, totally responsible and fourth in line to raise emma./ i'll be right there emma! just let me get my trusty diaper bag here."
chandler,"well, what do you know? i guess, i'll be the one who dies first."
phoebe,hey. does monica know about her broken plates yet?
monica,"well, you're... you're different funny... i mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks..."
chandler,"i do limericks... uhm... there once was a man named chandler, whose wife made him die inside."
joey,"(returned) no, no, it's okay, i already told the waiter what they want."
monica,why would you do that?
joey,"chandler, control your woman!"
rachel,"(lifts for a toast) okay, as everybody has ordered, i would like to start the celebration and make a toast ... to phoebe. she dropped her sock."
phoebe,aw ... what?
rachel,"n-no, emma dropped her sock."
monica,"mom's here? i wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town."
phoebe,you're welcome!
chandler,"honey, you've been in there for a long time... is everything okay?"
monica,not really.
monica,i have a problem.
chandler,really? what happened?
monica,"well, i was dancing around, and singing ""no w"
chandler,"i feel so bad. is there, is there anything i can do to make it up to you?"
joey,"you could go to the game with me, even though i know you said you couldn’t, but then you lied to me, tricked me and gave me a bump on the head."
chandler,i’m sorry. that’s the one thing i can’t do. i promised that i’d be with monica.
joey,[looking sad] alright.
monica,you can go.
chandler,[turning around] what?
monica,"you should go to the game. it’s okay, i want you to."
chandler,really? are you going to be okay?
rachel,"joey, come on! it doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen."
joey,"what? why not? rach, who can you not get?"
rachel,"oh! (pause) ok. ok, you really wanna know who it is?"
joey,"(eagerly) yeah, who is that?"
rachel,do ya?
joey,yeah.
joey,"right, of course. hey, did you guys finish the speech?"
ross,what about the guy from the bar?
rachel,what? who?
ross,the guy you gave your number to.
rachel,"whoa, how do you know about that?"
ross,"because he called here looking for you. so don’t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,"
rachel,why didn’t i get that message?
ross,what?
rachel,"from the guy in the bar, why didn’t i get that message?"
ross,because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket. do you...do you not look there?
chandler,"what? (pause) oh, yeah, i'm gonna be a junior copywriter."
monica,"oh sweetie, i'm so proud of you!"
chandler,does that mean i get the good loving tonight?
monica,you bet! no tv or anything! (she gets up from the sofa and goes to the kitchen area)
joey,"(to chandler) hey, that is so great about the job."
chandler,"thanks, man."
joey,and i like to think i had a little something to do with it.
chandler,really? what?
chandler,"eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, y'know? we'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
monica,you thought about that?
chandler,yeah.
monica,how many kids were we gonna have?
chandler,"uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
monica,what else did you think about?
chandler,nope.
phoebe,broke em all huh?
chandler,yup.
phoebe,you going to tell her?
chandler,nope.
chandler,"hey! so, i'm gonna put the plates back. y'know i think you're right...i don't think we should use these plates again for a long time."
monica,like only if the queen comes?
chandler,maybe not even then!
joey,"hey! i did it! i called my producer, i told him i had a family emergency, he totally bought it. thanks for teaching me how to lie phoebs."
monica,"honey, you know i think you're hilarious! come on, you know that joke you told me last week? the one about jerry lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) that slayed me."
ross,"hey... i made up that joke and told it to you! (he points at chandler. joey gestures to ross ""what are you doing?)"
joey,not knowing when to shut up...
ross,yep! that's my thing...
phoebe,"no, no, no, no, no... it's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. i was just saying goodbye to an old friend."
phoebe,"no, uhm... david and i did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in minsk. he's only... he's only in town for a couple of days."
phoebe,"no, no..."
rachel,"ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground."
phoebe,'s a good toast.
rachel,(to ross) could you please get her attention?
ross,w-oa ... mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)
phoebe,"(getting up) oh, for god's sake, judy, pick up the sock! pick up the sock! pick up the sock! (everybody scared) i'm sorry, was that rude? di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this evening? look, i know, you all have a lot going on, but all i wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. and you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) well, it's too late now."
ross,"well, ??? think that's us?"
phoebe,"well, this is, this is, this is not over! (on phone) hello?"
monica,"yeah, it’ll be fine. y’know, maybe i’ll stay and practice the art of seduction."
chandler,"you’re gonna put sweats on and clean, aren’t ya?"
monica,that’s gonna be so hot!
joey,"thanks, here’s ya ticket."
chandler,"thanks. listen, i’m never gonna lie to you again."
joey,okay.
chandler,and i want you to know that no-one thinks that you are stupid.
joey,"thanks, man. [they walk down the hall. chandler looks at his ticket. turns around and heads back to his apartment.] where ya going?"
chandler,"game’s tomorrow night, joe. [enters apartment]"
ross,"yep, we got it, we got it. (to charlie) thank you so much."
joey,"alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because i really wanna know who..."
rachel,later! la...
joey,yeah. (they leave)
rachel,"ok. see you, bye."
ross,good night.
joey,night.
rachel,ross?
ross,i never gave it to you.
rachel,why?
ross,i don’t know.
rachel,oh god. you know what? who you think you are? who are you to decide what messages i should or should not get?
ross,who am i?
rachel,yes.
ross,i am the guy who’s taking care of our baby while you’re out at bars meeting guys!
rachel,"oh my god, i cannot believe this. you know i actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you"
ross,none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! that’s not the point. ok? the point is you...you are the one
joey,"well, before, with the wishbone... i didn't wish we would win the lottery, i wished you'd get the job."
chandler,"(smiling, surprised) oh yeah? (looks towards the kitchen, worried) listen, don't tell monica, she'll rip your heart right out."
joey,oh yeah.
rachel,you know what? there is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
ross,me too. so much for my dinosaur/amelia earhart theme park.
phoebe,"you guys, what was the powerball number again?"
phoebe,we won.
rachel,what?
phoebe,we won!
monica,let me see!
chandler,"well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old."
monica,"(laughs) y'know what? i-i don't want a big, fancy wedding."
chandler,sure you do.
monica,"no, i want everything that you just said. i want a marriage."
chandler,you sure?
monica,uh-hmm.
chandler,i love you so much.
monica,i love you. (they kiss.)
phoebe,"no problem. next week, stealing!"
monica,bye plates!
joey,oh...you told her you broke all the plates huh?
monica,what?! something happened with the plates?
joey,er...(looks down) yeah...this er...raccoon came in and..er..[makes an action describing the path of the raccoon]
phoebe,"oh, well, yeah..."
phoebe,"stop it! stop it, before someone gets really hurt! (they stop and phoebe gets david's jacket and gives it to him) here david, you should just go."
phoebe,"okay, well... guys?"
phoebe,"i'm sorry, i'm so sorry. if you... if you want your key back, i totally understand."
phoebe,right! never! never! i swear! (they kiss... the door opens and david comes in again.)
joey,"yeah! allright! hey, hey ross. check it out! sandy taught me hot-cross buns."
joey,"(to chandler and monica) well, what is going on with you two?"
monica,"uch, you see, i'm ovulating."
chandler,"oh yeah, that's what she says. but maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed."
monica,"yes smokie, that is what it was. i just can't get enough."
chandler,(to joey) you not gonna believe this: she lied! she tricked me into having sex with her.
joey,"so? did have sex, right?"
chandler,what's the matter with me? why i'm such a girl?
rachel,"so, what did you guys do?"
ross,"you know, we just drank some beer…mike played with the boundaries of normal social conduct…"
phoebe,"well, goodbye!"
rachel,"have fun, pheebs! see ya guys. [phoebe and mike leave]"
ross,"rachel, lock the door, lock the door, seriously!"
rachel,"oh shoot, i forgot to pay phoebe for the drinks! [goes outside into the hallway] wait, wait. so, did he call? did that guy call?"
rachel,"oh, around 8:30?"
monica,i can't believe she's gonna say yes to david. she's clearly in love with mike.
chandler,"you know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that."
monica,"oh my god, he's gonna do it now. please, i cannot watch this, let's go."
chandler,"i think we have some time. have you ever heard him talk? (doing david) ""uh, phoebe, uh, i would be honoured, uh..."" spit it out, david!"
phoebe,"sure, ok, yeah."
phoebe,"oh my god, mike!"
phoebe,"no, mike's here."
monica,it's the humidity!
rachel,"oh, ross, this is just so messed up! what’s wrong with us? you know when people hear about our situation they"
ross,"uh, clearly."
rachel,"and you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. an maybe this, you know,"
ross,"yeah, maybe not. so what you wanna do?"
joey,hey!
rachel,hi. can emma and i live here for a while?
joey,"ha, oh, of course."
phoebe,don't tear it.
ross,"phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers."
phoebe,"i know that, but look, we've got the powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!"
chandler,"wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout."
phoebe,"(still very excited) i don't care, i've never won anything before, i can't believe this!"
rachel,"so pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?"
phoebe,it's not all mine. we all get 50 cents.
monica,you know what? you can have mine.
rachel,"(opens her present from ross; it's a dark-red scarf) oohh, i love it!"
ross,really? you're not gonna return it?
ross,really? sounded like three blind mice.
joey,noooo... three blind mice goes like this... (he puts his fingers in position on the recorder)
ross,(looks angrily at joey and points at him) i swear to god...! (joey is in shock)
joey,me! i'm up for puppets!
ross,"okay, okay... how exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?"
phoebe,"(returns) okay, that was mike."
rachel,"phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. you're totally right. we are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration."
rachel,then again at 9?
rachel,yeah…
ross,"hello? oh no, she’s not here right now. can i take a message? bill from the bar? okay…bill from the bar. i’ll make sure she gets your number."
rachel,ahhh.
ross,"so, er, so how was it? have you guys, you guys, had a good time?"
rachel,"oh, it’s so much fun. it’s so good to be out."
ross,"ah, rach?"
rachel,yeah?
ross,never mind.
ross,"hey, you guys!"
ross,ah.
phoebe,"what are you, what are you doing here?"
monica,"you're the most incredible woman i've ever met. how can i lose you? (phoebe looks very flattered) now, i don't actually have a ring..."
chandler,"i wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy."
phoebe,(smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) no!
phoebe,"i love you. but i never needed a proposal from you. i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future."
rachel,thank you.
chandler,me too.
joey,me too.
rachel,me too.
ross,i guess if everybody else is...
joey,"(sitting in a chair) hey guys, so i just called the powerball hotline, can you believe it? nobody won."
phoebe,i beg to differ (shows him her cup of coffee and her plate of cookies).
rachel,"well, not (the|this) second!"
phoebe,"(at the window) hey look, you guys, it's snowing!"
rachel,"oh wow, it's so beautiful..."
ross,"wow, it really is!"
monica,"""wendy"" is a fat girl name."
phoebe,aren't we done with that?
joey,"i wanna be mr. wigglemunch. (and makes a ""there"" nod to ross)"
ross,(shakes his head) oh my god!
rachel,that was kind of rude!
ross,"oh, i'm sorry. please apologise to sandy and the snufflebumps for me."
rachel,"you know, he was just doing his job..."
ross,"well, you know what... i-i'm sorry i'm the only one who isn't in love with gary poppins out there... but i just... i can't... i can't go through with this."
phoebe,"mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. huh, nkay, i'm gonna take off."
rachel,what?
phoebe,"oh, i love you guys too, but mike got off work early. wait. wait, i'm not t--not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. you know what? i am. bye guys! (waves to the bar) judy! bye."
rachel,"oh thank god, if phoebe's going, can we please take emma home?"
ross,"you know, i think that's a good idea--our babysitter just pounded in another chardonnet. (both get up) bye, y'guys."
phoebe,i’ll be right back. i just have to go to the bathroom.
phoebe,"david, i'm so sorry, i'm sorry."
phoebe,"yeah, i might have said yes, but that would have been wrong."
phoebe,yes! (they hug)
monica,(to everybody) because of our meddling! alright?
joey,your eyebrows look weird.
chandler,"“jeremiah was a bullfrog. was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but i helped him"
phoebe,"(hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the ""pigeon voice"" from before) coo, again. don't blame the pretty lady. it was not her fault. it was me, the pigeon, coo! (pause) seriously, stop staring at her."
monica,"okay, fine. let's talk about snow. -- do you think it's snowing in tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?"
chandler,hey!
ross,oh my god...
joey,"hey-heeyyy - look at that, it's a christmas miracle!"
monica,what are you doing here?
chandler,i wanted to be with you. i missed you so much.
joey,"hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?"
rachel,"oh, come on ross..."
ross,"no! hey, you know what? i'm sorry. i would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with..."
rachel,(sighs) oh... that's true.
ross,thank you!
monica,bye.
joey,"see ya. well, this is just us."
monica,"so, i'm, i'm probably still ovulating. do you want to give it another try?"
chandler,"so you never had sex with a kennedy, have you?"
chandler,"oh, ain't this nice? it's so quiet, i could just lie here all day."
monica,i know (she snuggles to him)
rachel,(walking in hurriedly) open your drapes! open your drapes!
chandler,i'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
monica,the sun is out!
chandler,hey! remember when i had corneas?
chandler,monica.
joey,got ya. (blinks an eye)
chandler,i never want to leave you again!
monica,"but i thought if you left, you get fired."
chandler,turns out they can't fire me. because i quit.
monica,what?
ross,"what, you, you really quit your job?"
rachel,"well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it. (ross walks to the living room determined to fire sandy)"
joey,(kind of emotional) i am learning so much from you.
chandler,"well, i'm off to tulsa, so if your maitre d. friend has any funny oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at http://www.hahanotsomuch.com/."
monica,"honey, you can relax. last night at work, geoffrey told this really sexist joke. after that, not so funny anymore."
joey,"do, do you gonna do it now?"
monica,we don't have much time. once the egg decended the oviduct ...
joey,"no-ohoh. (the bings leave, the waiter comes)"
joey,"nah, just me. all alone. (all the food is served) dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special."
monica,"ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and i'll get the magazines and the lotion."
chandler,ladies? ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
rachel,nooo!
chandler,"yeah! it's a stupid job, and i could not stand leaving you. and why should i be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?"
rachel,what do you really want to do?
chandler,(realizing) i have *not* thought this through!
monica,oh my god!
chandler,"i know, i, i should have talked to you first about it."
monica,"no, i think that this is what you wanna do, i think it's great!"
chandler,thanks!
phoebe,"chandler, your being here is the best christmas present i could have ever imagined."
chandler,(flattered) ahh...
phoebe,now give me my real gift.
chandler,"really...? see... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!"
monica,"okay, don't miss that flight. you know i love you."
chandler,i love you too. (monica and chandler kiss. he turns to joey.) and... i like you as a friend. (they hug and pat each other on the back.)
joey,allright. see you later!
chandler,see ya! (he leaves the apartment)
joey,excellent. the shrew in particular was exclusive.
joey,joey! joey.
joey,that's the best birthday ever.
monica,damn it!
ross,"(from across the wall) walls are pretty thin, guys!"
ross,then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
rachel,"look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, i'm so jealous!"
ross,"finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: gigantosaurus, argentinasaurus..."
chandler,(to a paleontologist sitting next to him) not to mention the cold sores.
ross,"and that's just the herbivores. i'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development."
chandler,(to the one sitting next to him) really?
ross,"but all kidding aside, in much the same way that homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus..."
joey,"he said ""erectus""!"
joey,"no, he really said it."
phoebe,(to chandler) thank you.
chandler,"(to monica) here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)"
ross,"oh, hey..."
ross,"(reading off his card) ""a donation has been made in your name to the new york city ballet."" -- how did you know?"
rachel,wha... are you kidding? i can't return this.
chandler,"i... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. besides, this gift still says i love you guys."
joey,mine's is to lilian myers.
chandler,i don't have a *job*!
joey,(to monica) did that guy really make that joke?
monica,"naaaa... he still kills me. last night he had me laughing so hard, i swear... a little pee came out."
ross,here goes...
ross,... and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus...
joey,erectus?
rachel,homo.
ross,(concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses) thank you!
ross,"oh, thanks guys!"
ross,oh!
ross,"(with a frozen smile on his face, realizing something's wrong with jarvis) ok... now... now we're just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)"
rachel,"all right! well, uh... (to monica) we're gonna hit the beach?"
chandler,"actuary... no. book-keeper... no. topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to monica:) hey, d'you know what i just realized? you are the sole wage earner. *you* are the head of the household. i don't do anything - i'm a kept man!"
monica,"you are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to chandler) hey, here's twenty bucks. -- why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while i'm at work tomorrow?"
rachel,i can't watch. it's like firing elmo. (ross walks to the couch where sandy sits)
ross,"sandy... hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. i'm afraid it's not working out."
ross,"yeah, uhm... i mean, rachel and i, think you are great... with emma... uhm... we just feel..."
rachel,(from behind the bedroom door) you! you feel!
ross,i... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. i'm sorry. we're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
rachel,"(from bedroom) oh, damn you geller!"
ross,"anyway, uhm...well, i'm glad there's no hard feelings."
ross,"no, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue."
ross,"you know, i'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you."
ross,why... i... i don't know. (sandy tilts his head again) uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
monica,yeah!
rachel,"(to ross, in a flattering tone) it was really... great!"
ross,"oh, thank you so much!"
joey,"yeah, and so funny!"
ross,"i mean, uhm... you know when i was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... you know a-a-and as a kid i wasn't the athlete i am now."
rachel,(from the bedroom) huh ha ha!
ross,"i play squash...! anyway, uhm... i uhm... i always get the feeling he thought i was too sensitive."
ross,"it was hard... i remember... i was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... ""what are you doing with those things? what's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?"
ross,"i know i am! (ross now starts to cry) ...and when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?"
rachel,oh!
ross,"(puzzled) ok!... all right, thanks! thank you so much, you guys! (to phoebe) oh, i can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!"
ross,"(skating over, embarrassed) ok!... uh... excuse me? yeah?"
ross,hey! (she turns to him) well...? (in expectation)
ross,here come some more...
joey,wow! you blow my mind...
joey,aaahh... how much do i owe you?
joey,it's like the cheapest college ever.
ross,yeah?
ross,"oh, i can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! i mean... uh, did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?"
ross,"no, it's ok! made me feel like a rock star!"
ross,(joking) i'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
ross,"(realizing his joke wasn't so good, but still giggling) look, i took it too far!"
monica,"(her hair bigger then before) i can't believe it's raining again! oh, it's so unfair!!!"
phoebe,"well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) not you guys. you got it going on!"
monica,"so, what are we gonna do today?"
monica,"(pleasantly surprised) ping pong? (to chandler) honey, they have ping pong! let's play!"
chandler,i don't think so!
monica,(disappointed) why not?
chandler,"because you know how competitive you get and well, i say it's cute, others disagree, and i'm lying!"
monica,i'm not always that bad!
chandler,"oh, yeah? what happened when we played last time?"
monica,(hesitatingly) i punched you...?
chandler,and...?
monica,... phoebe...?
phoebe,... and...?
monica,i clunked your heads together!
joey,"hey! (stands up) as soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! (smiles ecstatic)"
joey,"(disappointed) oh... oh, but that's ok, i'll find someone else to do it... i'll do it alone, but... i don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you..."
joey,"(interrupting her) hey! don't worry about it! it was fine! i ended up having the best time with rachel! i just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on ross's speech... (pulls a face)"
joey,"(bewildered) oh! oh, well! at least we're both having fun!"
joey,"yeah! a little bit, yeah..."
joey,"yeah... i think we do... (sighs, with folded arms)... about what?"
monica,"c'mon guys, it'll be fun!"
phoebe,"all right, all right... i'll play if we don't keep score!"
monica,but then how do we know who wins?
phoebe,nobody wins!
monica,"so, we're just four losers... super!"
chandler,i'm not playing with you.
phoebe,"yeah, i'm out."
monica,(smiling) ok!
phoebe,"mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!"
chandler,she gets crazy! this scar (points to his forehead) is from pictionary!
monica,sure! got to!
monica,aww!
chandler,"(nearly whispering) oh dear god, there's two of them!"
monica,"hell, yeah!"
chandler,(to phoebe) did you know this about him?
phoebe,no idea! i though he was soft like you!
monica,how much were you thinking?
monica,make it fifty!
monica,(nearly shouting) one thousand...
chandler,(interrupting her) ok!
monica,(going through her pockets) no... (to chandler and phoebe) either of you girls got a quarter?
chandler,"honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!"
phoebe,"(picks up a coin from her bra) monica, you call it."
monica,"heads! no, tails! he-he-heads!"
phoebe,tails!
monica,"(angry) ow, what are the chances!"
monica,ha! my point!
phoebe,(smiling proudly) he was a lawyer!
rachel,oh! weather bitch! (turns the tv off)
rachel,"it's open! (joey walks in) hi, joe!"
joey,(downhearted) hey...
rachel,"(worried) what, is everything ok?"
joey,uh... charlie and i broke up.
rachel,"nooooo, why?"
joey,"oh well, she said we have nothing in common."
rachel,"(laughing) oh, that's crazy!"
joey,"no, it's not, we have nothing in common!"
rachel,"... yeah, it's true."
joey,"i mean, she should be with someone like... ross! you know what i mean, he uses all those big words too! man, smart people are dull!"
rachel,"(pretending to be offended) what, hey!"
joey,"(laughing sarcastically) ok, rach!"
joey,"i feel so stupid, you know? why... why do i keep going after the wrong girls?"
rachel,"w-what are you, what are you talking about?"
joey,"oh, c'mon, i mean, there's you, then there's charlie, and it's like... (sighs) what the hell is my problem? oh! (he falls back on the bed)"
rachel,ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
joey,"(sitting up again) i'm telling you, rach, charlie is not right for me!"
rachel,"yeah, i'm not talking about her..."
joey,but then who? the waitress i went out with last month? (gives her a meaningful look)
rachel,you know? forget it!
joey,"(stands up) no-no-no-no, no! who, who were you talking about?"
rachel,"no, i-i-i-i don't, i actually don't know who i'm talking about! so!"
joey,"ok! all right, well... i'm gonna see if i can get a room for the night and i'll... i'll see you later!"
rachel,"yeah, sure!"
joey,you like me? (shuts the door)
rachel,"(nearly whispering) ok, let's not make a big thing about this!"
joey,(shocked) that's a huge thing!
rachel,"not working with me, joe! here's the thing: lately i have been having thoughts (pauses) musings, if you will!"
joey,what... for how long?
rachel,only like a month!
joey,(outraged) a month??
rachel,"what the... dial it down! (joey goes to sit on the bed) listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes i do, i have, i've been thinking about... you know, us! (looks at joey, who's totally distraught) ok, dial it up a little!"
joey,(stands up) i just have one question!
rachel,shoot!
joey,(desperate) what the hell are you doin'???
rachel,"i don't know, i'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... i mean, aren't you just a... little curious... (insinuating) what that would be like?..."
joey,"uh, am i curious? i mean, i am as curious as... as... george!!"
rachel,(puzzled) who...?
joey,"curious george! you know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!"
rachel,"oh yes, of course, i remember him!"
joey,"yeah, he had a paper route."
rachel,"yeah, he did! (smiling) oh, see, this is what i'm talking about!"
joey,"no, i know, yeah i know we're great but rach no... this... this can't happen!"
rachel,but can it... just... happen a little bit?
joey,"(charmed, but then recoiling) no, no! it can't happen at all!"
rachel,"but why, why not?"
joey,"because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? (in a trembling voice) i have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did i ever say no! (sighs) i couldn't do it to ross!"
rachel,but that wasn't gonna stop you before!
joey,"i know, i know! but i've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... (painfully) i'm sorry...!"
rachel,"(regretful) i'm sorry, too! (they look at each other sadly, then she recollects, and puts her hands over her eyes) oh god! i shouldn't have said anything!"
joey,"no! no-no-no-no-no-no! hey! hey, we'll be fine! li... hey, like you said: no big deal!"
rachel,it's not a big deal!
joey,no big deal!
rachel,it's so not a big deal!
joey,yeah! i'll see ya later! yeah!
rachel,ok!
rachel,"ok, i..."
rachel,aaahhhh!
monica,"ooh! i'm sorry! i think, i think, that may have missed the table!"
monica,"ah, yeah!"
monica,"ah, yeaaah!"
monica,ah yeaaaah!
chandler,(to phoebe) do you really find this attractive on him?
phoebe,"(looking at mike) oh, yeah! (turning to chandler) are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by monica, right now?"
chandler,i think this is the first time in our marriage that i've felt like the more attractive one.
phoebe,"c'mon mike, you can beat her! knock that dog off her head!"
monica,"oh, damn it!"
phoebe,(pointing at mike and shouting) i sleep with him!
monica,"(threatening) don't get too cocky! remember i won the last one! oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?"
monica,"no, no, nooo!"
chandler,"okay-dokay, you've each won a game and i've lost what's felt like a year of my life. so everybody goes home a winner."
monica,best out of three?
chandler,should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
monica,"(to mike) serve the ball, chump!"
phoebe,"(to mike) ok mike, better come back mike, better come back."
ross,"ooh, well. ah, i kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that i wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man. (mr. oberblau giggles)"
ross,get out!
ross,"yes, please! (they move and sit down on a sofa) so, what's going on?"
ross,"oh my god, wh-what happened?"
ross,i knew that was him!
ross,"(holding her hand) hey, you ok?"
ross,"oh, professor clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here."
ross,"(standing) ok, gentlemen! please! aren't we a little old for this? i mean, we're scientists, right? we're academics. and most importantly i... you-you will have to catch us first. (he starts to run away with charlie). go, go, go! (the paleontologists starts chasing them)"
chandler,"(exhausted) ok, look! enough is enough!"
monica,"no, i have just to have two more points to beat him!"
chandler,"monica, that was also true an hour ago! i mean, please, look at you! your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!"
monica,i can't just walk away! i've put in four hours!
chandler,but...
monica,"look! you knew this about me when you married me! you agreed to take me in sickness and in health. well, this is my sickness!"
chandler,what about the obsessive cleaning?
monica,that's just good sense!
monica,"(in pain) aww! (she holds her hand, moaning like she's biting back a scream)"
chandler,you ok?
monica,"no, no, no. honey, i'm ok. shake it off! (she shakes the wrist and it's more painful) oh, no! no shaking, no shaking! ooh! ooh! (pause) oh my god! i can't play!"
phoebe,mike wins?
monica,i can't believe it! (pause) i lost!
chandler,"no, you didn't."
monica,what?
chandler,because i'm gonna play for ya.
phoebe,you can't do that!
phoebe,"ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister."
monica,"(to chandler) honey, you don't have to do this."
chandler,"(in a loving voice) yes, i do. now, i may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because i love you."
monica,but... you suck!
chandler,"(still in a loving voice) you're welcome, sweetheart."
chandler,"all right mike, let's get this over with. sudden death. whoever wins this point, wins."
monica,oh my god! you're good!
phoebe,it's like watching porn!
chandler,and that's... how... it's done!
monica,(to chandler) oh my god. that was so amazing! when did you (pause) hold on! i almost forgot (she turns to mike) loser! (back to chandler) when did you stop sucking?
chandler,"i never sucked, i actually didn't want you to know how good i was!"
monica,why?
chandler,i don't know.
monica,this is so great! now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
chandler,that's why!
ross,hi.
ross,"yeah. the bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. (pause) you know, we as a group are not the coolest."
ross,i don't think they saw us.
ross,(apparently unruffled) oh. can i... can i ask who?
ross,"i think i know too but i've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so..."
ross,i'm sorry... we... we can't.
ross,"i mean, you just went out with my best friend, and i just think it'd be a really really bad idea. (pause) or-or not! (they kiss passionately)"
rachel,what?
person,dialogue
chandler,"so, you and rachel tonight, uh?"
joey,yeah. it's actually our first official date
chandler,wow! so tonight may be the night! you're nervous?
joey,"naa, no. this is the part i'm actually good at."
chandler,what must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
joey,(pause) it's ok!
chandler,how can you be so confident?
joey,"well, i... i know exactly what i'm gonna do!"
chandler,really? like you have a routine?
joey,"no, no no no no. see. each woman is different.you have to appreciate their uniqueness."
chandler,really?
joey,"no, i do six things! first, i look deep in her eyes. then, i kiss her. next i take my hand and i softly graze her thigh."
chandler,you mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way)
joey,"no! not like that, no no. no, like this. (he starts lightly grazing chandler's thigh)"
chandler,"oh, i see what you mean, that's quite nice. (they look at each other, both embarassed)"
joey,more foosball?
chandler,...and beer!!
monica,(entering) hey!
monica,(to chandler) hey sweetie! (they kiss)
ross,(looking at monica's legs) wow!
chandler,hey! stop staring at my wife's legs! no no! stop staring at your sister's legs!
ross,"i'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?"
chandler,she went on one of those spray-on tan places.
ross,"eh, you got a spray-on tan?"
monica,chandler gets pedicures!
ross,"(laughing) why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?"
chandler,(to monica) why...why?
ross,"still, i can't believe that's sprayed on... i mean, it looks really good. i wonder if i should get one!"
chandler,"sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off."
ross,"so, do you get colours or just french tips?"
monica,there. here's their card.
ross,"thanks. (he takes the card) hey, i know where this place is! it used to be an x-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he is saying) florist. (he goes away)"
phoebe,hey!
chandler,hey pheebs!
monica,hey phoebe!
phoebe,"oh, you won't believe who moved back to town."
monica,"i know, amanda! ah! she called me too! she's the worst!"
chandler,who's amanda?
monica,"she's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. then she moved to england and she picked up this fake british accent. on the machine this is her message. (she apes amanda using an awful british accent) ""monica, darling! it's amanda calling!"""
chandler,are you trying to do a british accent?
monica,(pause) (to phoebe) chandler gets pedicures!
chandler,"just so i know, how many more of those can i expect?"
phoebe,"you know what amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? (apes amanda in a british accent) ""oh, so sorry to catch you on your mo-bile!"" if-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-bile, don't call me on my mo-bile!"""
monica,"i know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met."
phoebe,"oh, i know! ""oh...i slept with billy joel"". all right, who hasn't?"
monica,"oh, what are we gonna do! i don't wanna see her!!"
phoebe,"ugh, let's just cut her out!"
monica,what?
phoebe,cut her out of our lives! just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
monica,"oh, i guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! (to chandler) have you ever done that?"
chandler,"no, had it done to me though. feels good !"
ross,"well... i like how you look, what are you?"
ross,"two, i think a two."
ross,"spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat."
ross,"well, i have a phd, so... (assistant walk out, not impressed by this statement) (ross takes his bathrobe off and he enters the tanning booth. he stands up in front of the red light and the sprayer starts and sprays his face and torso)"
ross,"one mississipi, two mississipi, three mis...(the sprayer starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) wait! wait! i'm not-i've not finished counting!! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room)"
ross,you sprayed my front twice!
ross,"no, i barely even got to three mississippi."
ross,"mississippilesly? (pause) well, how bad is it?"
ross,"so, how dark is it gonna get?"
ross,i'm a four?
ross,(sarcastically) really!
ross,(annoyed) ok!
ross,"wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! how do i know when it's gonna start? hello? (he slowly turns and the spraying begins, on his face) ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns again and is sprayed in the front again) ah! (he spits and angrily goes out of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) the same thing happened again!"
ross,(hysterically) i'm an eight!
joey,"i thought you paid. (rachel does not answer and seems puzzled) ha, guess we won’t be going back there!"
rachel,so.
joey,yeah.
joey,"hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?"
rachel,"i say ‘cheesy line’, but ok."
joey,what’s the matter?
rachel,"i am sorry, i don’t know, i am sorry, i don’t know why i did that!"
rachel,"ok, so sorry."
rachel,"i am sorry! again... i don't know, i don’t know what happened, i must be nervous!"
joey,"i don’t get it, chandler loved it!"
rachel,"ok, ok, ok. i promise, i promise, i promise, i won’t do it again. i really do. i promise. this is gonna be great."
joey,ok.
joey,"(a little giddy) uh, was that good for you?"
phoebe,"oh, yeah. could be rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again."
monica,it could be amanda!
phoebe,"oh, you’re right! i was just kidding about rachel. babysitting is a gas!"
monica,you're from yonkers! your last name is buffo-martisis!
phoebe,"ok, don’t hold thy breath!"
chandler,hello? is someone on the line?
chandler,"hang on, she’s right here. (he enters the living room and hands the phone to monica) someone's on the phone, for ya."
monica,"we weren’t picking up, it’s amanda!"
chandler,(to amanda) i get pedicures!
monica,"hi amanda! actually now... it’s... is not a good time. dinner tomorrow night? (phoebe mouths 'no') ok, phoebe and i will see you then!"
phoebe,"why, why, why didn’t you just say no!"
monica,"well, i said 'no' to her coming over now! i couldn’t say 'no' twice! i get this uncontrollable need to please people!"
phoebe,"(leaving) fine, fine! you would not hold up well under torture!"
monica,and you would?
phoebe,i did!
rachel,"absolutely! absolutely. i d... it’s just a little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some getting used to."
joey,"ok. well, how, how can we make it easier?"
rachel,"ok, let’s work from the top down! (joey nods, but then puzzled because he does not get it) just work the bra, joe!"
joey,"ok, yeah, got it."
joey,this thing welded shut?!
rachel,okay.
joey,"all right, turn around, i got to get a look at this thing."
rachel,oh!
rachel,ow!
joey,sorry!
rachel,well this is romantic!
joey,"i'm sorry! (he stands up) this never happened to me before! i'm an expert at taking off bras! i can do it with one hand! i can do it with my eyes closed! one time i just looked at one, and it popped open! i blame your bra!"
rachel,it’s a standard issue bra clasp!
joey,then i blame you! yeah! that's right! you threw me off with all your slapping!
rachel,"ok well, well i'm really, i'm sorry about that joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?"
joey,(contemplates for a few moments what rachel just said) nah! i don't have another level!!
chandler,hold on! there is something different.
ross,i went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
chandler,was that place... the sun?
ross,"oh! and it gets worse! (turns his side to chandler and monica and pulls up his shirt. there's a distinct line across his body, where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)"
chandler,oh my god! you can do a duet of ebony and ivory all by yourself!
monica,"how could you mess this up? it's so easy? you go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!"
ross,(looks at her suspiciously) how do you count to five?
monica,one two three...
ross,"(yells) damnit! (goes to the door to leave. rachel just enters, sees him and starts laughing)"
rachel,(laughing) oooh! oh oh!
ross,(still yelling) i know!
rachel,oh oh! what is up with miss hawaiian tropic?
chandler,how was your date with joey?
rachel,"well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and i kept slapping it away!"
chandler,you didn't like that?
rachel,"well, it wasn't just me, alright? he freaked out too! he couldn't even undo my bra!"
monica,"wow, really? one time he just looked at my bra and it popped open."
rachel,"i do not know what's wrong with us, i mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! but this time it was leading somewhere and i was very aware of the fact that it was joey touching me."
monica,"well, you guys have been friends forever. remember the first time that you kissed ross? how weird that was? you couldn't stop laughing? you got through that."
rachel,"(looking thoughtful) ok, that's true. that's true, we can do this. you're right, you're right, we can do this. we're just gonna power through!"
joey,hey chandler can i talk to you for a second (points to the hall).
rachel,"(to joey) no need!! problem solved, we are powering through (at which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment)."
monica,"(sees what he is doing) chandler, stop! it is not going to pop open!"
chandler,(without taking his eyes off the bra) you don't know! (monica just smiles)
monica,hey phoebe!
phoebe,hey!
monica,is amanda here yet?
phoebe,no.
monica,"(sits down) oh good. good, look i'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. but i have a new plan. chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency."
phoebe,"oh! well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?"
monica,"well, what do you think of mike and chandler being in a car accident?"
phoebe,"(makes a face) are you kidding, i love it!"
phoebe,hi!
monica,hi!
monica,(beaming) yeah! yeah! his name is chandler and...
phoebe,musty!
joey,"okay, ross, i realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. let me explain, okay?"
rachel,we weren't doing anything!
joey,"rach, he just saw us."
rachel,shhh.
joey,"but what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? one kiss."
rachel,"no, come on, that is a lie. we also kissed in barbados."
rachel,"yeah, you started it! i've got to chill."
joey,"look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but.."
rachel,"we feel so terrible about this, ross."
monica,when were we not friends?
monica,"ehm, we were friends in 1992."
monica,(to phoebe) you were going to cut me out?
phoebe,well...kinda.
monica,oh my god!
phoebe,"yeah well, in america you're just an ""ass""."
monica,"(into the phone) hello? chandler, what's wrong? (she listens) oh my god, are you alright? (listens some more) yeah, i'll be right there. (she hangs up and speaks to amanda) i'm so sorry, but chandler was in a car accident. (she gets up)"
phoebe,(also gets up and starts taking her purse) oh my god. was mike with him?
monica,nope! (she turns and leaves)
joey,(to rachel) hey!
rachel,hey! got champagne?
joey,"yes ma'am, ready to power through!"
rachel,"excellent! stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (starts to remove her bra from under her clothes)..."
joey,uh! (when she's done she throws her bra at him)
rachel,"ok (starts to light some candles) sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. (claps her hands and jumps at joey, clearly very excited) alright! lets do it!"
joey,"ok, you're scaring me a little bit."
joey,"yeah, but it did happen, so..."
joey,ross?
rachel,ross? (to joey) can we just close the door?
rachel,"ross, say something. anything."
ross,so you two are..?
ross,and have you .. ed?
joey,"no, no, no!"
rachel,"no, no, no!"
ross,"but if i hadn't walked in here, would you..?"
joey,probably.
joey,"no, no!"
rachel,"ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. you have every right to go nuts."
ross,i'm not going nuts. do you see me go nuts?
rachel,"no, but you know what i mean."
ross,"hey, hey, hey... if you two are happy, then i'm happy for you. (squeaky.) i'm fine!"
joey,really?
rachel,"oh! get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (she pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) ok. aha! you like that huh?"
joey,oh! yeah!
rachel,"you like that? (she climbs on the barcalounger seductively, putting her knees next to joey's hips.) let's take this into high gear (she pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. she puts one of her knees between his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)"
joey,uh uh!
rachel,"yeah baby, i'll show you how we do it!"
joey,"no, no, no! you kneed me in my misters!"
rachel,what? oh my god! i'm so sorry. joey? are you ok?
joey,"(he just sits there, legs very close together with a painful look on his face) soldier down!"
monica,we are not friends with phoebe anymore.
chandler,"if she asks, i protested a little, but ok!"
phoebe,"oh chandler! thank god you're alive. monica, can i talk to you outside for a minute?"
monica,i have nothing to say to you.
phoebe,"please, monica? in the hall?"
chandler,"well, aren't you a treat."
monica,"i can't believe you tried to cut me out. why phoebe, why?"
joey,"(enters the room) hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?"
chandler,"(browsing through a diary) well, let me see... i-i believe i'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the tv."
joey,"look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play."
chandler,i could fall asleep at a play.
phoebe,what is it?
joey,"it's a one-woman play called ""why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life""."
monica,it sounds interesting!
ross,"yeah, it does sound interesting, i mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, i don't think it gets bett... (ross starts snoring, faking to fall asleep)"
phoebe,"i know, i know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?"
ross,"absolutely. (very squeaky.) i'm fine! totally fine. i don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, (deep voice) i'm fine. i'm not saying i wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. i mean, at first i was like.. (screams.) but now that i've had time to absorb it; lovin' this."
joey,ross..
ross,"it's all working out! me & charlie, and you two. you know what we should do?"
rachel,calm ourselves?
ross,"no. we should all have dinner. yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. i'll cook!!"
joey,"look, don't you think that will be a little weird?"
ross,"weird? what? what's weird? the only thing weird would be if someone didn't like mexican food, because i'm making fajitas!! (storms off.)"
joey,i do like fajitas.
monica,"god, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. there's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. there are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives."
chandler,there's a hair in my coffee.
phoebe,hey guys!
monica,hey.
phoebe,"hey, have you seen frank jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets."
chandler,"you know, it's funny. every time you say ""triplets,"" i immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds."
monica,that's sweet. drink your hair.
phoebe,"it was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? you were really controlling and compulsive and shrill."
monica,i'm still all those things!
phoebe,you're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
monica,(starts smiling) i am scrappy.
phoebe,"exactly! look, no matter what i tried to do, i couldn't keep you out of my life. of all the people i have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in."
monica,it's because i'm scrappy.
phoebe,"yeah, you are. and i'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because i don't know what i would do without you."
monica,i won't know what i would do without you.
monica,"well, i guess we should go back in. when you gave me another chance, i guess we should do the same for amanda."
phoebe,"yeah, i guess you're right."
ross,"i'm gonna stop you right there, glenda. okay? does it look like this is my first time, huh? now i want 4 two's... and i want them all on my back."
ross,"wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?"
ross,which... which... which... which one is it?
ross,oh! son of a bitch!
rachel,what is the matter with us?
monica,"oh, the way you crushed mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.you wanna...? (plays with her finger on chandlers chest)"
chandler,"you know, i'd love to, but i'm a little tired."
monica,i'll put a pillowcase over my head.
chandler,you're on!
phoebe,hey!
monica,what's up?
phoebe,"well, okay, mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. and then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want..."
ross,... finally...
phoebe,is that ross?
joey,"you guys are gonna have a great time, i promise!"
ross,what? how come that you don't have to go!
joey,"i wish i could but i just found out that i have to be at work really early the next day, so i can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want."
chandler,"(browsing through a diary) uh, let's see, who do i hate?"
rachel,"(gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but joey blocks her way) oh, sorry... oops, sorry."
joey,"(lifts rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) hey, here you go."
rachel,"ooh... oooh... (pause) (rachel is all bah-jiggity about joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to monica) can i ask you a question?"
monica,yeah.
rachel,do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
monica,"no, i don't think it ever works. why?"
rachel,no reason.
monica,"no, no, rachel?"
rachel,yeah
monica,who do you wanna fool around with?
rachel,"(with high pitched voice) nobody, forget it!"
rachel,(giggling and whispering) maybe.
phoebe,"hey, what's all this stuff?"
monica,"oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies."
phoebe,"ooh, babies! oh, this one is so cute, get this one!"
monica,that's not really how it works.
phoebe,"oh, how does it work?"
monica,i don't know!
phoebe,"well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, bill and colleen. they adopted a kid. i'm sure they'd help you."
monica,"thanks, that would be great. hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?"
phoebe,hey!
phoebe,good to see you.
monica,hi frank.
monica,"oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!"
monica,which one is which again?
joey,"well, i know what's the matter with me."
rachel,"no, i mean with us, you know. i mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?"
joey,i don't know.
chandler,"that fake british woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... hey!"
rachel,"hi! hey, listen, can we ask you a question? when you and monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?"
chandler,"kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys..."
rachel,"no, no, no... no, i mean... se-x-u-ally..."
joey,"yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?"
chandler,"actually, no. no, it felt right. you know, it felt like uhm... i can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time."
chandler,"i can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... well, i'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(chandler leaves the apartment. joey sighs)"
rachel,"well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us."
monica,"yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls."
phoebe,sounds like he's with someone.
chandler,"he could be alone. this morning i heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps."
monica,"wait a minute, i think phoebe's right. you know i hear someone else in there with him."
ross,"god, you're amazing... i didn't even have to ask you to call me that."
monica,"oh my god, that's charlie!"
chandler,she's cheating on joey with ross!
phoebe,oh that tart... floozy... giant...
monica,i'm not sure about this.
phoebe,"yeah, you're right. this is none of our business."
monica,no i'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. someone get me a glass!
phoebe,"oh, i'm not gonna do this, okay? i'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend."
rachel,(through wall) ooh... i love barbados!
joey,ooh... i can't believe i'm kissing you. i'm kissing rachel!
rachel,"i know, i'm her!"
phoebe,(whispering) rachel and joey! it's rachel and joey!!!
monica,(whispering) you can't!
rachel,"(whispering) why? (monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with ""because"") seriously i did not understand a word that you said."
monica,in the hall.
monica,you wanna fool around with joey?
rachel,"yeah! you know, ever since i had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! and what's the big deal, people do it all the time!"
monica,who? who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
rachel,"ok, off the top of my head... don and janet."
monica,"who, who are they?"
rachel,i know them from work.
monica,both of them?
rachel,"no, one of them..."
monica,which one?
rachel,"i don't know, what were the names i just said?"
monica,"rachel, things can get incredibly complicated."
rachel,"all right, all right, you're right, i won't do anything with joey, i just thought that we (joey enters the hall) ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion? (joey enters his apartment)"
joey,"ah, can i just say i know we're doing this for ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date."
rachel,"well, what would we be doing?"
joey,"i'd take you out for a romantic night. some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home..."
rachel,feel me up?
joey,in a carriage!
joey,"hey, charlie!"
rachel,hey.
rachel,"oh, you bet."
joey,"so, did you bring a little something for ross?"
joey,"oh. oh, thanks."
joey,"yeah, i didn't throw any of that out.."
ross,"i thought i heard voices! hi charlie! (kisses her.) hi joey. (hugs him.) and.. oh! you're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. (laughs.) i'm just kidding, i know rachel, i know. (he squeezes her hand.) come, please come in. come in."
joey,"yeah, yeah... absolutely. i mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit."
rachel,"right, totally."
joey,"yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it."
rachel,"yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex."
joey,that's a... pla-an.
joey,(sighs) wow... i did not see this coming.
rachel,i know.
joey,"i don't get it. i mean, i was so sure this was what i wanted."
rachel,hmmm... me too...
rachel,i wonder how monica and chandler could do it?
joey,i guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
rachel,aah... i bet you're right.
joey,so...
rachel,yeah.
joey,i love ya.
rachel,"love you too... alright, i'm going to bed."
joey,"yeah, me too."
monica,what?
phoebe,get over here!
rachel,ooh...
chandler,wow!
monica,"(in her monica-excited-way... too loud!) oh my god, i love how thin these walls are!"
monica,(muffled) thank you.
rachel,"hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? what changed?"
joey,"well, i only said that because of ross, you know. then i saw him kissing charlie..."
rachel,"what? ross and charlie? (joey nods) wow! she's really making her way through the group, huh? ah, who am i to talk?"
monica,i can't believe this. rachel and joey?
chandler,how about the dinosaur twins in the other room? no-one is manning that wall!
monica,i'm on it!
chandler,anything?
monica,i think i hear curtains closing...
phoebe,we've got shoes being kicked off over here.
monica,"bedsprings, unmistakable!"
monica,what the hell are you cooking!
ross,hey!
monica,hey!
chandler,hey!
ross,"hey, you guys won't believe what i have to do for work today."
chandler,"yes, but, ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs."
ross,"(covering with his hand chandler's face, like pretending he's not there) (to monica) there're these two professors who are joining my department and i have to meet them here and show them around campus."
monica,what's so bad about that?
ross,it's i just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
monica,(fingering her elbow): ross?
ross,"(looking his elbow, where there's a patch) these aren't suede."
ross,"hi, hi, i'm ross geller."
ross,"oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice."
ross,"oh, no, it's no big deal, i mean, if i weren't doing this i'd just, you know, be at the gym working out."
rachel,"okay, well, we brought you some wine."
ross,oh! that is so thoughtful. (to joey.) she's a keeper. and what did you bring me? (grabs the bag that charlie brought for joey.)
joey,"uh, actually, that's.."
ross,"underwear, a toothbrush, and van halen cd. i can use all these things!!"
ross,what? fine? because i am! aren't you? aren't you? aren't you? you see? who else is fine?
joey,"okay, listen, hey, ross. why don't you try to relax, okay? maybe have a drink."
ross,you know what? that is a very good idea. i'm gonna go make a pitcher of margaritas.
phoebe,"oh, god. so adorable. look at them sleeping there like angels."
phoebe,"well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute."
phoebe,"oh, god, the last time i babysat them, they did the funniest thing.."
phoebe,"that's a, that's a long time."
phoebe,"yeah, i know, frank. i counted them when they were coming out of my area."
phoebe,what?
phoebe,"oh my god, frank, are you thinking of leaving? because i didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!"
phoebe,what?! you can't separate them! that's terrible. which one?
monica,thank you so much for seeing us. phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
joey,"ooh, yeah, i'm not going anywhere for a while."
chandler,"dude, it's chandler. let me in."
ross,go away! i don't want to see anybody.
chandler,"i know, i went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. you have to let me in."
ross,really? did you count mississipily?
ross,"dude, you're not tanned."
chandler,"no, i just had to get a picture of this."
chandler,i see you later!
chandler,you do realise that's your brother?
monica,"not until you said it. somebody switch! (chandler makes a clicking sound with his fingers and phoebe runs to the other wall. monica returns to chandlers wall.) wait a minute... ross and charlie, joey and rachel, phoebe and mike! we're the only people leaving with the same person we came with."
chandler,that's not true. i came with monica and i'm leaving with weird al.
monica,"okay, i've had it with the hair jokes. tomorrow morning, before we leave, i'm going to the salon."
chandler,okay buckwheat!
phoebe,"you gotta hear this, it's great... it's like free porn! (chandler eagerly rushes over)"
ross,weh...*sigh*
ross,"yeah, it's just... i don't think i can do this..."
ross,"no, no! (they're moving to the side of the bed, where they sit down) look, i need to talk to joey. i mean, you guys just broke up. before anything more happens between us, i need to know he's okay with it."
ross,"alright, i'm gonna go find them... (twitches a bit, looks down) i just need a... need a before i can... you know. (gestures standing up... they sit and wait for a while) grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries to concentrate...) okay, i see you later."
phoebe,that's the door. he's gone...
chandler,and she's... turning on the tv... and watching... miss congeniality!
monica,(to chandler) is he gonna introduce us?
chandler,"(to monica) no, i think we're just blurry shapes to him now."
ross,"oh, ha, i wrote that in one minute."
monica,(to chandler) twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
ross,"(hitting monica with his suitcase) (to charlie) we should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover."
ross,i don't think so.
ross,"oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is ""if you can't come on time, then don't come at all"". (pause) an option that many of my students use. (pause) shall we?"
ross,"you know what, he's a big boy, i'm sure he'll find us, ok?"
ross,"oh, damn it!"
joey,(entering the room) hey!
rachel,hey!
joey,what's happenin'?
rachel,"yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight."
chandler,"so, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?"
chandler,"i mean, you have a lovely home."
monica,"well, we appreciate anything you can tell us."
monica,oh my god!
monica,thank you. (to chandler.) i think i just had a tiny orgasm.
chandler,that's great. (to monica.) can i see the book?
chandler,"you want me to wash my hands first, don't you?"
monica,it's.. it's just so pretty and white.
monica,can i adopt you?
chandler,"hey, you must be owen."
chandler,"i'm chandler. hey, i was in the scouts too."
chandler,"yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother."
chandler,you know how to use a compass?
chandler,you do? that's fantastic!
chandler,"i'd love to, but i gotta get back to talking to your parents. they're telling us all about how they adopted you."
monica,"honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!"
ross,"hey, what are you guys doing?"
phoebe,"oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) i love you... paradise hotel, golf resort and spa... (she walks away from the wall)"
monica,"(also hugs the wall) yeah, we had a great time, thank you! (walks to phoebe)"
chandler,(caresses the wall with his finger) bye!
ross,"okay, uhm... hey, you guys seen joey anywhere?"
chandler,he's probably in his room with his current girlfriend charlie. that's the situation as we know it... (walks to phoebe and monica)
ross,"well, if you see him could you please tell him i'm looking for him?"
chandler,you got it!
ross,thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the wall) thank you! (closes the door)
monica,"other wall, people! other wall!"
ross,"(knocks on door) rach, you there? (joey and rachel both get up from the bed)"
joey,"oh my god, it's ross. what are we gonna do?"
rachel,"oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. just be calm. for all he knows we're just hanging out together. right? just be nonchalant. (joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) that's not nonchalant!"
joey,no idea what it means.
joey,"oh, i'd love to, but i gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first"
rachel,"oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine)"
joey,(yelling) stupid jane rogers!!
rachel,(angry) you are having a party tonight??
joey,kinda have a... a thing for the days of our life's people.
rachel,and you weren't going to tell us? how did you think you were gonna get away with that?
joey,i do it every year.
rachel,you do that every year??
joey,i didn't have to tell you that!! i'm stupider than jane rogers!!
rachel,"oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??"
joey,yeah...
rachel,and last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
joey,yeah...
rachel,"oh! and the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?"
joey,(smiling) i can't believe you guys went for that one!
chandler,what?
chandler,i got nothing.
ross,"the first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood."
rachel,"well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some."
ross,"oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? you know? just the four of us. just hangin'."
joey,"dude, are you okay? and when are the fajitas gonna be ready?"
ross,"i'm fine! hey, i'm great! i'm just.. i'm just proud of us. there's no weirdness, no tension."
rachel,no awareness.
ross,"we make a great foursome. we should do more stuff together. ooh! let's take a trip. okay, where do you think we - we can go?"
ross,my fajitas!!
rachel,"look, charlie, i just want you to know. ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of joey and me. you know, he normally doesn't drink like this."
ross,"fajitas! be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!"
rachel,"ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!"
ross,that is gonna hurt tomorrow!
phoebe,"okay, well, this is crazy. can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?"
joey,"(talking to a pineapple in his hand) god, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?you know you want it to happen as much as i do."
joey,i want you.i need you.let me make love to you.
rachel,"i don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but i think a canelope might hurt less."
joey,"oh, ehm...i'm...i'm rehearsing my lines.they gave me a big romantic story on days of our lives. it's the first time my character's got one. i'm so nervous, you know, i really want it to be good!"
rachel,woow!i haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
joey,"yeah, that was a disappointment...(pause) oh, hey!d'you want to come down to the set and tell me if i'm doing ok?"
rachel,(excited) are you serious?
joey,"yeah!hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again."
rachel,"(speaking to herself and reading cosmopolitan) oh, lucky me! coffee and a live sex show!"
rachel,"oh... oh, i'm sorry! i'm not... i was just-i was just reading to emma."
rachel,"yeah, yeah... it's... ""climax your way to better skin""."
joey,"so you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good."
rachel,"(hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!"
joey,oh hey rach!
rachel,yeah...
joey,maybe you could take charlie shopping.
rachel,"oh... okay, just hide!"
ross,(knocks) rach?
rachel,"coming! try under the bed, try under the bed!"
rachel,there's no room under the bed. (looks around because she can't find joey anymore)
ross,is everything okay?
rachel,"yeah... (still looking to see where joey went, and opens the door)"
ross,hey.
rachel,hi...
ross,you know where joey is?
rachel,...i really don't... (looks around again)
ross,can i talk to you for a minute?
rachel,"yeah, sure... (looks outside into the corridor if joey is there)"
joey,i don't believe this... have you guys been...
phoebe,shhh... this is the listening side of the wall.
ross,"and then she told me that she and joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me."
rachel,(clearly not listening and still trying to find out where joey went) uh-huh... right... yeah...
ross,and you know i wanted to ask charlie out since the day i met her.
monica,"it's so weird, how did joey end up kissing charlie last night? i thought you'd end up kissing charlie."
ross,"hey, i thought i'd end up kissing charlie too ok? but surprise!"
chandler,"i missed most of the party (pause) charlie's a girl, right?"
ross,"yes, she is this new professor of my department that i did not kiss."
rachel,"i don't know why joey had to kiss her! i mean, of all the girls at the party, god!"
ross,why do you care so much?
monica,"yes rachel, why do you care so much?"
rachel,(worried) be-cause ross is the father of my child! you know... and i... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) i just... all i'm saying is... i don't think that joey and charlie have anything in common.
joey,"monica, hey, can i borrow the porsche?"
monica,ok.
joey,alright!
monica,but ehm...what is it not?
joey,(abashed) a place to entertain my lady friends.
monica,and what else is it not?
joey,(even more abashed) a place to eat spaghetti.
monica,very good! (gives him the keys) what do you need it for anyway?
joey,"oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in new york, so..."
rachel,"joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?"
joey,"you're fine, ok? but everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!"
rachel,"well, then so you just invite me...!"
joey,"(speaking aloud) please, i was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!"
rachel,"oh, joey, come on! please, please! let me come, i will behave, i promise! i will behave! please, please, please..."
joey,"ok, ok! fine! you can come, but don't tell anybody else. it's up on the roof at 8."
rachel,"(yelling and jumping like a child) oh, a soap opera roof party!! i'm going to a soap opera roof party!! oh my god, oh my god!! (realizing how she's behaving) and it's out of my system!"
ross,"(very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to charlie) so, where did you get your undergraduate degree?"
ross,"(to charlie) oh, it's not over!"
ross,so basically all nuts?
ross,i've lost the will to live.
ross,what?
ross,"oh... ok, fine. but... ehm... i just have one question for you, ehm... (aping professor spafford) when we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll..."
ross,"(entering with charlie) oh, hey you guys! this is charlie! charlie, this is phoebe and my sister, monica."
phoebe,hi!
phoebe,insane.
phoebe,"alice would never go for it, right?"
phoebe,"well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. which one would you be willing to give up?"
phoebe,frank jr.jr.?
phoebe,uh-huh.
phoebe,"well, alright, that's fine. what about leslie?"
phoebe,"alright, so that leaves chandler."
phoebe,"wow, frank. i think we just ran out of kids."
phoebe,"i'm sorry, frank. i didn't realise things were so bad. you know, i'll help out more. i can - i can babysit any time you want. you name the day, and i'll be there."
phoebe,"well, that's not good. but you know, i can move some stuff around, and i'll be there. you and alice just take the whole day together."
phoebe,are you kidding? that's what sisters are for.
chandler,where are bill and colleen?
monica,they're in the kitchen getting something to eat. can you believe how nice they are?
rachel,"hey, that was an honest mistake!"
joey,"right!(he starts to ape her)""oh my god, is this the men's room? oh, i feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?"" (he inclines his head as if to look at a man's private parts)"
rachel,"yeah, that was an awesome day!"
monica,hey!
phoebe,hey!
ross,hi!
monica,"so, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?"
phoebe,sure!
ross,i'd love to!
monica,well you can't! we're booked solid for the next month!
phoebe,"well, i can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!"
rachel,"oh, well..."
joey,"are you kidding? rachel loves to shop! and she has great taste! yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes."
rachel,"ok, uh-uh... let's-let's shop!!"
joey,"(to charlie) ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, slutty!"
phoebe,"(entering and talking on mobile phone) ok, great! all right, bye! (she hangs up) pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) that's off, right?"
joey,"what's the matter, pheebs?"
phoebe,"oh... mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. and she was like ""oh, don't worry! i asked him. he's totally ok with seeing you!"". so now i have to go so he'll think that i'm totally ok with seeing him!"
rachel,"which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!"
phoebe,exactly!
rachel,and you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
phoebe,"(after a short pause) i didn't even think about that! (pause) aaargh, sexual politics!!"
rachel,"hey pheebs, i'm-i'm taking charlie shopping, why don't you come and i'll help you find something."
phoebe,"ok, that'll be great!"
joey,"oh, ain't that nice? the three of you trying on slutty lingerie together."
rachel,that's not what we're gonna do!
joey,"why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?"
rachel,"(still searching) oh, i know... i know it's been really hard for you."
ross,"anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. i mean, how angry do you think joey is gonna be?"
rachel,"(now looking up at the ceiling) that is hard to say, ross. that is hard to say."
ross,"you know, i gotta go find him. he's gotta be here someplace."
rachel,you would think!
rachel,joey!
joey,is he gone?
rachel,(still can't find him) how are you doing this?
joey,pssst...
rachel,how... wha... hey! what are you... what is this? have you guys been listening this entire time?
phoebe,"now, what is this?"
rachel,"ah, what is this? well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so i guess this is sixth grade!"
phoebe,oh no... have you thought about it how complicated this could get? what about ross?
joey,"well, he's with charlie now."
monica,"yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. and as his friend, i mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?"
joey,"(long pause and he twitches a bit) you're a pain in my ass, geller!"
rachel,"all right, look you guys... look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between joey and me and i think we can handle it..."
ross,"oh, i don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils..."
phoebe,"wow, joey and a professor! can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and joey's raw sexual magnetism... oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!"
rachel,"all right, so... ross, you're ok with all this? i mean..."
ross,"yeah, it's no big deal. i mean, i just met her and i'm fine with it..."
ross,"oh, god. i forgot how hot she was!"
joey,hey!
ross,i'm gonna get some more coffee.
ross,ok. (they both go)
chandler,"(to joey) so, a professor, uh?"
joey,"yeah! she is cool, and she's so smart! her mind is totally acrimonious (which, being joey, he mispronounces ""amonious""). (pause) that's not how she used it...?"
ross,"uhm no! think less of you! no, i don't think less of you. i mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. i mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, i hate those people."
ross,"yeah, i know the type."
rachel,oh! so you're driving up to connecticut?
joey,(hesitates for a moment)yeah connecticut...not west virginia.
monica,"hey, maybe i'll drive you up there! i'd like to buy some tickets myself!"
joey,uh!
monica,"yeah with chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars."
chandler,"yeah, because if i was at my old job we'd say 300 million? no thank you!"
phoebe,hey will you get me tickets too?
rachel,"yeah me too. oh! i have an idea. why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!"
ross,no thanks!
phoebe,you don't wanna win the lottery?
ross,"(in a mocking voice)uh...sure i do, and i also wanna be king of my own country and find out what happened to amelia earhart."
chandler,still on amelia earhart?
ross,the woman just vanished!
joey,"seriously, ross, you don't want in on this?"
ross,no! do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? i...i mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
chandler,yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
ross,"yeah, charlie is gonna be joining my department."
phoebe,"oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) oh, ok, now, what do you think of ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?"
phoebe,"ah, ah."
ross,(to phoebe) ranion's theory of species variegation?
phoebe,"yeah, i saw the article on your coffee table and i memorized the title to freak you out!"
monica,"(to ross) so, did you two have fun?"
ross,"oh my god, she's great! i mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny..."
monica,and i don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud) hotty!! (charlie looks at her) hi!
rachel,"(she enters wearing a bath-robe) hey... hi you guys! listen, you know what? i'm not feeling really well. i think i can't get out for the play."
ross,really? wh-what's wrong?
rachel,"i don't know! i think it's kind of serious! oh, you know... i was watching this thing on tv this morning about... newcastle disease... and i think i might have it!!"
rachel,"... ok, who is this?"
ross,"i'm sorry, rachel, this is charlie wealer, she's a collegue."
rachel,"oh, hi! i would check your hand but... i'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!"
monica,"hey, rachel, can-can i see you for a sec?"
chandler,we have to leave!!
monica,why? what did you do in the bathroom?
chandler,"i didn't get to the bathroom. i bumped into owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. and there's a slight chance i may have told him."
monica,"oh my god, where's my purse? no, you know what? i can replace everything in there. get that binder, and let's go!"
chandler,but kids are so intuitive. don't you think on some level he already knows?
chandler,see? intuitive!
chandler,which technically now you should give back!
chandler,"i'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. ""owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that santa is real."""
ross,everyone? i would like to make a toast to rachel and joey.
rachel,ooy.
ross,"and to love. ah, love. l-o-v-e, love. l is for life. and what is life without love?"
rachel,"oh my god, are we supposed to answer?"
ross,"o is for ""oh, wow!"" the v is for this very surprising turn of events, which i'm still fine with by the way. e is for how extremely normal i find it. that you two are together. and now one day you might get married and have children of your own."
ross,"phoebe, what happened?"
phoebe,"well, it was an accident...you know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!"
chandler,(to monica) have i got a surprise for you? pack your bags!
phoebe,oh no!you guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
chandler,"what? no, i'm taking monica to a romantic inn in vermont (shows them a brochure)!"
phoebe,"oh, good!ok, good for you!try to recapture the magic!"
chandler,"so, what do you say? can you get out of work?"
monica,"oh, honey!i can't. i was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!"
chandler,are you really that busy?
monica,"yeah, i'm sorry. i really am."
chandler,"oh, that's ok.i'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) ""hi, this is chandler bing. i made a reservation there and i need to change it (pause) oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? can i just come some other time? (pause) oh, can't you make an exception?"""
monica,tell them i'm a chef in a big new york restaurant!
phoebe,and tell them that in 2 weeks i will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
chandler,"(on the phone) ""look, this is ridiculous! i'm not paying for that room! ok?"" (pause) ""oh, thank you very much!"" (hangs up) yeah, i'm going to vermont..."
ross,"oh, don't worry about it! just use your travel insurance."
chandler,i don't have travel insurance.
ross,"well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!"
chandler,(looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) wow! fortunately she has a very pretty face!
monica,"oh, i so can't believe this! my uterus is an inhospitable environment? i was trying so hard to be a good hostess!"
chandler,"oh, i can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!"
chandler,hi.
monica,hi.
monica,ok.
chandler,"oh, damn it!"
monica,"don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out."
monica,(long pause) ok.
chandler,"is that a hint? because we love you doctor connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (dr. connelly glares at him) wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!"
rachel,"hi! ok, you're ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping?"
joey,"(to charlie) alright, have a good time. (they kiss)"
rachel,not gonna find any clothes in there!
ross,"(entering) hey, you guys!"
chandler,"okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? the people that care about you?"
rachel,sure...
chandler,enunciate!
rachel,get out!
rachel,are they right?
joey,"probably, yeah... i mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to ross."
rachel,"yeah... yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight."
joey,"yeah, i think that'd be best... so, so i'm gonna... i'm gonna take off..."
rachel,(joey walks to the door) although...
joey,(turns around very fast) i like although!
rachel,"i mean, you know... ross and i haven't dated in like... six years..."
joey,six years? wow... it's almost as long as highschool...
rachel,"plus, you know, he is with charlie now."
joey,absolutely! he's not thinking about you.
joey,"hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. no? am i getting close?"
phoebe,(entering) hey!
monica,hey!
phoebe,hey you guys! look what i just got. (she shows them a pair of slippers)
rachel,"oh, oh! wow, i love those! where did you get them?"
phoebe,i bought them off ebay! they used to belong to the late shania twain.
rachel,"(after a pause) phoebe, shania twain is still alive!"
phoebe,oh... then i overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)
monica,"hey, what's this?"
rachel,"oh, it's a gift certificate to this new spa in soho."
monica,"oh, you can't show phoebe this! she hates those corporate massage chains."
rachel,"ah, why, now i can't get a massage? there are so many things that she disapproves of! i can't eat veal, i can't wear fur, i can't go hunting..."
monica,do you wanna go hunting?
rachel,"well, i would like to have the option!!"
phoebe,"(coming back from the bathroom) what's up? (she sees the gift certificate in rachel's hands) hey, rachel!!"
rachel,oh!
joey,i like those odds!
ross,"seriously you guys, i can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, i mean that's such a bunch of boohaki."
chandler,(looking around at the others)i'll ask. (to ross) boohaki?
ross,"oh oh, we think emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her."
rachel,"yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker."
monica,how do you know she's gonna start talking?
rachel,well when i talk to her i almost feel like she understands what i'm saying.
chandler,kinda like joey.
joey,(who wasn't paying attention)what's that now?
monica,god! look at all these tickets! it's so exciting! you know i haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
chandler,pie eating contest?
monica,oh! you assume because i was heavy that's the only way i could win something?
chandler,"no, i saw a picture of you covered in blueberries."
monica,(smiling)that was a good day!
rachel,sure! (monica takes her apart) oh...
monica,you're not sick!
rachel,"what? yes, i am!"
monica,"ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??"
rachel,"when you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe)"
monica,you just wanna stay home so you can make a move on joey!
rachel,"oh, no, no! i heard you before, that is so not what this is!"
monica,"ok, what is this?"
rachel,ok! (whispering) joey is having a secret days of our lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
monica,(aloud) what?
ross,(looking at them) wh-what's going on?
monica,joey is having a secret days of our lives party up on the roof!
rachel,and he didn't want you guys to know about it but i came over here to tell you!!
joey,(entering) hey! i'm all packed and ready to go!
ross,"oh, that's right! (to emma) daddy and uncle joey are going on a trip today. we're going to a conference in barbados, right?"
chandler,did you see our bank statement? could this be right?
monica,i know...god. i haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed oreos. what happened to all our money?
chandler,i'm not sure what they did...but i'm inclined to blame ***
monica,"i guess with you doing the internship, we're spending more than we're bringing in."
chandler,maybe i should quit and get a job that pays.
monica,oh...but you're finally doing something that you love! i can't ask you to give that up. though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was..y'know..finding gold
chandler,you know what? you know what? i think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? so we pay our bills a little late this month. and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. and maybe we start eating out of joey's refridgerator for a change. you're chef..what can you make out of bacon soda and beer?
monica,ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
chandler,no! we're not borrowing money.
monica,why not?
chandler,hey! ready to go?
ross,"oh yeah, let me just finish this."
joey,"hey ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, i can't do that!"
chandler,what are you doin'?
ross,"have you seen this? it's a new alumni website for college! it's cool! you can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to."
chandler,"great, a faster way to tell people that i'm unemployed and childless ."
ross,it's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember andrea rich?
chandler,the tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
ross,"uh uh... well, her internet company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident..."
chandler,bet she'd sleep with you now...
ross,no... i already e-mailed her.
joey,"dude, are you okay?"
ross,totally.
rachel,"ross, you don't seem okay."
ross,no!
ross,wasn't it? and you thought it would be awkward with joey and that you never really liked rachel.
ross,okay.
rachel,"oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me."
ross,"okay, i guess it's just flan for three! hey, hey, that rhymed!"
rachel,"you know what, ross? i think we're gonna take off too."
ross,"oh, oh. of course. god, i'm so stupid. you guys are a couple now. i mean, you probably just want to be alone."
rachel,"no, no, it's just that it's getting late..."
ross,"hey, hey, it's fine. it's totally fine. we've got plenty of margaritas. it's all good."
ross,i don't even know what that's for.
joey,you know what? i think i'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
monica,why don't you take ross?
ross,"uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? i mean, two guys in a romantic inn..."
monica,"no, not if their room has two beds!"
ross,(browsing the brochure) i guess...it still seems a little...(enthusiastically) moonlight boat ride!!
rachel,"hey joey, is this the bed where olivia lost her virginity?"
joey,"i don't know, but one of the extras sure did! (pause) hey, listen rach. thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!"
rachel,"oh, please!honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, i'm...oh my god!is that christian sanders?he's so gorgeous!"
joey,also so gay!
rachel,"oh, in my head he's done some pretty ""not-gay-stuff""!"
joey,"well, at the christmas party him and santa did some definitely gay stuff!"
joey,"oh, wish me luck!"
rachel,"ok, not that you need it but good...god!is that chase lassiter?he's straight, right?"
joey,"rach, i gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay i don't know if i could do this!"
rachel,"oh, i'm sorry, you're right.i'm sorry, good luck! (they hug)"
rachel,hi.
ross,guess who's up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference?
ross,"yeah, right! what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and charlie laugh, then joey starts laughing too without any reason) well, why are you laughing?"
joey,"just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!"
ross,"professor sherman, yeah. i've a meeting with him today."
ross,"yeah, well... i think i know how to dazzle him."
rachel,"oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?"
ross,"tsz... no! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve)."
chandler,(entering) hey guys!
ross,"wait a minute, you guys. oh, i wanna ask you something. i-i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do, i'd love for you guys to come and hear me."
chandler,"i think i can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick."
ross,it's in barbados.
chandler,but you come first!
rachel,i'm there!
joey,bye.
rachel,no...
joey,i'm thinking about you...
rachel,yeah...
joey,let's forget about ross...
rachel,forgotten.
joey,what's wrong?
rachel,nothing...
rachel,"nothing... it's really... it's nothing... come here, come here..."
rachel,"sorry, i just uhm... i can't seem to get ross out of my head..."
joey,"well, maybe i can help. (he grabs her head passionately, closes his eyes and kisses... ross in rachel's dress! he realises it too late, and when he does, pushes ross's/rachel's head away)"
joey,yeah... we really need to talk to ross...
ross,hey!
chandler,hey!
ross,you guys ready to go?
chandler,"not quite. monica's still at the salon, and i'm just finishing packing."
ross,dude! you're not taking your bible?
phoebe,"no, you can't go there! you know how i feel about these ""big massage places""! they're putting people like me out of business!"
monica,"and she wants to go hunting, too!!"
rachel,"phoebe, come on, i don't wanna waste it! it would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!"
phoebe,"ok, this is not about the money, ok? it's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells."
rachel,i don't care about any of that!!
phoebe,"well, do you care about friendship?"
rachel,oh!
phoebe,"i feel really strongly about this, rachel. please, don't use this gift certificate. i'm asking you as a friend."
rachel,"oh, not as a friend, phoebe!! fine, i won't use it!"
phoebe,promise?
rachel,i promise.
phoebe,thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)
rachel,but i am going hunting!!
monica,(entering) hey honey! i missed you today!
ross,"(yelling to monica)they're towing your car, they're towing your car!!"
monica,i'm parked in a garage on morton!
ross,(panting)they're towing a car. and i am seeing...spots.
joey,(sounding panicky)oh my god ross! you don't have emma! and rachel you don't have emma! (starts yelling) where's emma? who has emma!?
rachel,joey relax! my mother picked her up two hours ago. you were there!
joey,(not yelling anymore)i was?
joey,i did?
rachel,she dropped off a casserole?
joey,oh yeah! the casserole lady.
monica,"(to ross)so, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?"
ross,"yeah, uh... and then i figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!"
chandler,"(hysterical)don't touch the phone! i'll get it, i'll get it, i'll get it!! (picks up the phone)"
ross,(to monica)think he washed his hands?
chandler,"(into receiver)hello? hey charlie, what do you know?"
rachel,(to monica)what's going on?
monica,"chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. but out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three."
joey,ooh! tough odds!
rachel,ok professor or detective?
phoebe,joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
rachel,"yeah, and he does it every year! that's why he's sending you to that play! that's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!"
phoebe,and that horrible museum tour!
ross,"no, i arranged that..."
joey,"(sounds tired) hey you guys, i'm turning in. have fun."
phoebe,we know about your party joey.
joey,what party?
monica,the game's over! take off your robe!
joey,(looks perplexed and opens up his robe) ok... i mean...
joey,(to charlie after covering himself up again) nice to meet ya! (charlie waves hesitantly and joey leaves)
joey,"(to some people) hey! hey alright! hey, glad you could make it (shakes a man's hand) thanks for coming."
monica,oh my god! kyle lowder!
monica,(yells after him) i love you!
joey,"hey, that's why i didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something..."
monica,oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
joey,mmh-mmh.
ross,(to emma) can you say barbados?
joey,barbados!
ross,"ok, i gotta say. i mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! uh! and i've a surprise, uh... i had to pull some strings but i was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! that's right! (he gives them their passes) this babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars."
rachel,do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
chandler,"yeah ross, i mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff""."
phoebe,i think david would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
ross,"oh, right, because he's a scientist!"
phoebe,"no, no, because, you know, he's been in minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die."
ross,"ok, we gotta go, yeah? so, we'll see you guys tomorrow."
joey,"all right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally."
ross,"it's a blanket joe, not a cloak of invisibility!"
ross,(very excited) look at all these paleontologists!!
chandler,because we don't do that. we are bings! and if there's one thing my father taught me was...well to always knock before going into the poolhouse...but the other thing was...never borrow money.
monica,wow! i had no idea you had this much pride.
chandler,that's right! i do! and i'm your man. and i'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
phoebe,oh...you don't have to go...i have something that will fit you.
phoebe,i want you to stay.
phoebe,why don't you turn them inside o-
phoebe,i'll miss you.
phoebe,great! ok...i'll go get the tube top.
phoebe,"wow..mike hannigan...you sure know how to make a girl say ""hell yeah!"""
phoebe,yeah! let's do it! let's live together! (they embrace and mike kisses phoebe)
phoebe,oh god...we're really going to move in together!
phoebe,"i've always wanted to live with a guy..""pick up your socks!"" ""put down the toilet seat!"" ""no! we're not having sex anymore!"" it's gonna be fun!"
monica,hey joey!
joey,hey!
monica,listen...i need to know that what i'm about to ask you..will never get back to chandler.
chandler,"let me see what you wrote about yourself: ""doctor paleontology, two kids... "" (pause) you split with carol because you have different interests?... i think you split with carol because you've one very similar interest!"
ross,"you know what? i'm gonna finish this later, ok? let me just grab my coat."
joey,hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again)
ross,(he picks up the ball) what do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)
chandler,"maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on ross' computer) ""also i cloned a dinosaur in my lab. she's now my girlfriend. i don't care what society says. it's the best sex i've ever had""... aaand send!"
joey,"(he stops chandler from posting the message) no, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!"
ross,"(he comes back) alright, let's go!"
joey,dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from ross' hands)
ross,i think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
joey,(after ross leaves the room) aaand send! (he hits the send button)
rachel,hey! how was basketball?
joey,"oh, it was a lot of fun right up until chandler got a finger in the eye!"
rachel,"oh, no! who did that?"
joey,chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near emma's cot) rach... what's hugsy doin' in the crib with emma? (he looks puzzled)
rachel,"she was just crawling around and she found him, so i just let her sleep with him. that's all right? isn't it?"
chandler,hey!
joey,hey!
joey,where’s monica?
chandler,oh she’s at home putting up decoration for rachel’s birthday party tonight.
joey,and you are not helping?
chandler,"i try, but…apparently singing “i will survive” in a helium voice, not helping."
ross,hey you guys!
joey,hey!
rachel,"shhhh…don’t say that loud, gunther gonna wants to hug me…(chandler and joey nod in agreement)"
rachel,"yeah, that's probably a good idea."
joey,yeah. i'll see you in the morning.
rachel,"uh-huh. okay. you know what, joey, i don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this."
joey,"it doesn't look good, does it?"
joey,morning. here you go.
ross,thanks. did you stay here all night?
joey,yeah.
ross,so you took off my pants and shoes?
joey,"no, no, no. you actually did that when you were dancing to the chicago-soundtrack. look, ross, about, about rachel and i. listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? because nothing is gonna happen."
ross,what do you mean?
joey,"well, she and i said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. and clearly.."
ross,"hey, what are you talking about? i'm fine!"
joey,"it's okay, ross, alright? i totally understand. of course you're not fine. you're.. you're ross and rachel."
ross,"except we're not. i mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. oh my god, is that right? has it been that long?"
joey,"that's what i hear, yeah."
ross,"this is crazy. i mean, six years? and because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? can i ask you something? really, what is this thing with you and rachel?"
rachel,"(watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) oh!"
rachel,ssshhhhttt!!he's asking her a question!!
rachel,"no! (pause) or, cut!you know, that's your call!"
monica,thank you!
monica,thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) you haven't said anything...
monica,oh..please!i-i welcome criticism.
monica,what musician?
phoebe,"(playing guitar and singing) and there's a country called argentinaaaa, it's a place i've never seeeeen. but i'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. humaaan spleeeeen. olè!"
monica,what are you doing here!
phoebe,"well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so i am here to entertain!"
monica,great!
phoebe,"yeah! it really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! yeah, ""you suck"" and ""shut up and go home""."
monica,listen phoebe...
rachel,"bye, see ya. (she goes)"
chandler,(sitting down on the couch) ok.
joey,"all right, so. how did it go at the fertility clinic?"
chandler,not as much fun as last time. apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
ross,so-so what did the doctor say?
chandler,"well... there's surrogacy, but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her."
joey,so you're ruling out surrogacy?
chandler,yeah.
joey,"so, i don't have to learn what that means?"
chandler,"aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors."
joey,"enough said, i'm there for you man. where is she, upstairs?"
chandler,(stopping joey) ah-ha!
ross,how do you feel about all this?
chandler,i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don't think there is one.
joey,"come on ross, be a good guy. step up and do it!"
ross,(puzzled) what?
chandler,"you're not supposed to take that. besides, it's a new testament, what are you gonna do with it?"
ross,learn about jesus...
ross,hey!
ross,"uh, no... no. i couldn't find him. i'm just gonna talk to him on the plane."
ross,stop it!
ross,you're filthy!
phoebe,"hey, have you guys seen monica?"
ross,"uh, actually i think she went to the salon."
phoebe,"oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright..."
monica,check it out!
phoebe,who's day just got better? chandler!
chandler,hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
monica,what do you think?
chandler,i think.... i think i can see your scalp.
chandler,"oh, yeah?"
monica,yeah. (they kiss) what d'you wanna do tonight?
chandler,"oh, well... maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites monica to have sex on it)"
monica,"ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? know your audience! besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank."
chandler,we really need to take those tests?
monica,"honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. i think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. just a few routine tests."
chandler,but i don't wanna do it in a cup!
monica,what is the big deal?
chandler,it's weird! in a doctor's office?
monica,it's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a taco bell?
chandler,"(embarrassed) i cannot believe ross told you that! (pause) and in my defense, it was a wendy's!"
monica,"look, i don't wanna do this test either, but i really do think it's a good idea!"
chandler,"yeah, ok. i'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the hershey's factory!"
monica,(really embarrassed) oh!
chandler,"oh, yeah! rachel talks too!"
joey,(sipping red wine from a glass) who says that wine has to cost more than milk!
ross,(mockingly)yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
joey,(smiling)look who's coming around!
chandler,(still on the phone)damnit. alright call me when you know more.
joey,(excited)did you get it?
chandler,one of the slots got filled.
joey,(still excited)by you!?
chandler,sense the tone! no that kid nate got it.
monica,oh! i hate that guy! i mean come on kid! pull up your pants!
chandler,yeah i know.
rachel,"well, there's two spots left right?"
chandler,"yeah...i mean i want this so much! i mean, i wanna get one, i want my friend charlie to get one...except i don't care about charlie."
phoebe,"(excited)hey you guys! ok, you're not going to believe this! i just saw my psychic and she said i was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!"
monica,"hey that reminds me, i thought we could use some extra luck so i brought a wishbone home from work."
ross,(mockingly)a psychic and a wishbone? guys! give someone else a chance!
monica,"alright, who wants to do it?"
phoebe,"oh can i? vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. it's really not fair either! you know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!"
monica,"ok, hey rach?"
phoebe,hey!
monica,"(excited) oh my god, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? i can barely control myself."
phoebe,"monica, you might want to remember that you are married. where is chandler anyway? (looks around)"
monica,(shocked) oh my god! chandler!
chandler,where the hell is everybody?
monica,"(to rachel) hey! joey said no autographs! but if she's gettting one, then i want one too: to monica. and none of this ""best wishes"" crap. i want ""love""."
rachel,"ok actually mon, matthew was just giving me his phone number."
monica,oh man! if i had known i was coming to this party i never would have gotten married!
rachel,nice to meet you.
rachel,ok
monica,(yelling after him) we will!!
monica,(to rachel) look at you with all the guys!
rachel,yeah!
monica,i guess you have forgotten all about joey?
rachel,"yeah, well, i guess i have forgotten about joey and clearly you've forgotten about chandler!"
monica,please... chandler is the love of my life... (at which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! have mercy! (follows the man in the leather)
joey,"i know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! (a woman goes towards them)"
joey,"(to charlie) i think i've been recognized, this happens all the time!"
joey,that... never happens...
ross,"wow! this is very flattering, uh..."
ross,"uh, uh... sure! um... ""dear..."" (he takes the notepad)"
ross,"""... sarah. i dig you"", uh? ""doctor ross geller""."
ross,"yeah, oh and sarah... i'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, professor wheeler, a-and this is joey tribbiani."
joey,"no, god, no! no! no no, i'm an actor. you'd probably recognize me from a little show called ""the days of our lives""."
ross,"dude, it's just ""days of our lives""... there's no the."
joey,"(thinking he's kidding) ok, ross! it's... it's fun, yeah! no, i-i play doctor drake ramoray."
joey,you don't own a tv? what's all your furniture pointed at??
monica,"david, can you help me?! i'm trying to explain to chandler how a plane stays in the air."
monica,(to chandler) see?
chandler,"yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind""."
monica,"alright, i'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip."
joey,i'd be lying if i said i haven't thought about it myself...chandler is my best friend..it would be wrong. good...(he winks)...but wrong.
joey,awww..i don't know monica...you know...erm...lending friends money is always a mistake.
monica,but chandler lent you money!
joey,and i think he would tell you it was a mistake.
monica,come on...i just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
joey,oh...how much?
monica,two thousand dollars?
joey,two thousand dollars!? what do you think i am? i soap oprea star!?
monica,yeah...
joey,that's right i am! (opens drawer and rummages through it. rachel enters)
rachel,hi you guys!
joey,oo...what's in the bag?
rachel,"oh er..well you know emma started crawling? i realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. so i went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment."
joey,"oh...baby-proofing...why is this such a big deal now? y'know..when i was a kid it was like.. ""whoops! joey fell down the stairs!"" or er.. ""whoops! joey electrocuted himself again!"" huh!"
monica,anyway erm..are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
joey,"(still very puzzled) oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... i know that!"
rachel,"joey... are you sure? i mean, i know how much you love him!"
joey,"rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? i do not love hugsy. i like him a normal amount..."
rachel,"all right... oh, emma loves him!"
joey,why wouldn't she? he's a wonderful person!
phoebe,hi.
monica,hey phoebe... how you doin'? you feelin' better?
phoebe,"breaking up sucks! oh, i really miss mike!"
chandler,"oh, i'm so sorry!"
phoebe,"oh god, i tried everything to make myself feel better. i even tried writing a song about it... but... i can't think of anything that rhymes with aarrgghh!! (pause) hey monica, i really need your help getting through this..."
chandler,you're not gonna need my help?
phoebe,"well no, when i get to the point where... you know... i'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about mike... i'm gonna come to you."
chandler,"oh good, 'cause i've already thought of 3... 4! i've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)"
phoebe,"ok. i mean i know i did the right thing. you know, mike never wants to get married and i shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon i'm gonna miss him so much. i'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that."
monica,"ok, you got it!"
chandler,"yeah. that’s a lot of cats, jolene. single, are ya?"
chandler,chandler bing.
joey,[on phone] hey. how come you’re answering your own phone? where’s your crazy assistant?
chandler,"what’s up, joe?"
joey,okay. what have we wanted to always do together?
chandler,braid each other’s hair then ride horseback on the beach?
joey,"no, no, no. when you get home tomorrow night, you and i are gonna be at the wizards – knicks game courtside!"
chandler,courtside? oh my god!!
chandler,hey!
ross,yeah! yeah! ok! sure! look! can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
chandler,sure! just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! do you believe that who ever
ross,ok you...you really don't know what i am talking about?
chandler,no!
ross,ok! last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
chandler,our balcony? seriously? that's so funny because i told monica we should put lights on our balcony. and she said
ross,"right that's why i came over to talk about. hum...i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,"
chandler,so are you gonna...talk to her?
chandler,hey!
monica,"good morning, tiger! i'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. you're gonna get me good and pregnant."
chandler,i've got nowhere to go this morning. i'm unemployed! i don't know what i'm gonna do with my life.
monica,"well, i just lost my erection."
chandler,"i mean, what am i supposed to do with myself?"
monica,you're supposed to find your passion in life. you can be whatever you wanna be now. it's exciting.
chandler,but it's all so overwhelming. i don't know where to start.
monica,"hey, wait a second. i can help you with this. you just need to be organized. we can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. there could be folders and files!"
ross,"err…good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. (point to molly)this is molly. molly, (point to chandler) chandler, (point to joey) joey."
ross,"(looking at emma) oop, somebody get a little fussy."
joey,you damn right i am. i’ve been waiting for cookies for 7 minutes!
rachel,"ok. you know what, i just gonna take her outside."
rachel,"wow, molly is just great!"
ross,yeah
chandler,"yes, bravo on the hot nanny."
rachel,what? you really think she is hot?
chandler,"are you kidding? if i wasn’t married, she would be rejecting me right now."
rachel,joey?
joey,(looking at molly outside)how do you think she’s doing?
rachel,am i the only one that doesn’t think she is hot? ross?
ross,"nehh!...i mean she’s not unattractive but…hot(making his face, as if saying “no”)"
rachel,thank you.
chandler,now that rachel’s gone?
joey,"come on, i mean, you know me, you know..."
ross,joey.
joey,i'm crazy about her.
ross,and she feels the same way?
joey,i think so.
ross,"well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on."
joey,"yeah, but, ross, i mean, you're not okay with it."
ross,"no, but i wanna be. hey, i will be. besides, i'm with charlie, right? oh my god, i'm still with charlie, aren't i? i mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?"
joey,"no, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. are you sure about this?"
ross,"yeah, i'm sure."
joey,and we're okay?
monica,"hey, phoebs"
phoebe,hey.
monica,"uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. bill and colleen hate us."
chandler,"owen didn't know he was adopted, and monica told him."
phoebe,yeah.
monica,"you know how much i love listening to your music, you know, but..."
phoebe,but what?
monica,this is kind of a classy place.
phoebe,"(pause) ok, say no more."
phoebe,"(with a fancy dress, still playing and singing): it wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! everyone! it wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to monica, showing her dress) classy, uh?"
chandler,"hi, chandler bing, i have a reservation."
chandler,new york.
ross,(in a strange voice and eating candies) the big apple!
chandler,"i'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here."
ross,"yeah, i ate all my gifts for everybody."
chandler,"well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?"
ross,(high pitched voice) check again please!
ross,not there.
chandler,"let me get this straight. i called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and i was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?"
ross,(looking astonished) what? no! i am not going to give them ben!
ross,the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
ross,"(reading from a notepad) i mean, we've been accepting leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) so-so what i am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! i mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, i mean, truly the mind boggles!"
ross,"oh, that's not what you want..."
phoebe,"oh, i'll take some of that."
rachel,"pheebs, that's for men!"
phoebe,"no, i know, this way when i go to the party later mike will know i am over him cause i'm gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) yeah."
phoebe,"ok. oh good, i'm dating a russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). seriously does anyone buy this? i smell like beets!"
rachel,"on melanie griffith in ""working girl"". i think what you want is over here."
rachel,really?
rachel,"oh, i can't. because i-i've seen them."
rachel,"yeah! i'm a big fan! of the movies, you know. motion pictures. the talkies!"
phoebe,"(picks up a dress) hey rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?"
monica,don't you just love it?
ross,ye... yeah... yeah... you got shellfish in your head.
ross,"you've never said that in your life, have you?"
ross,i thought so.
monica,and listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells tingle)
chandler,what d'ya know... it's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
joey,"whoo, whoo. wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that i'm sitting next to charlie after we broke up."
chandler,"yeah, it's almost if air barbados doesn't care about your social life."
joey,"look, does someone mind switching to sit with charlie?"
ross,"oh, i uh, i mean, i... dude, i spent the whole conference with charlie."
joey,i understand...
ross,"no, i'll do it. (he quickly grabs joey's boarding pass and gives joey his one.)"
chandler,wish i could switch with someone. i really don't wanna sit with allen iverson over there.
phoebe,"uhm... you know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin..."
phoebe,aaah... you're not good at this...
joey,heeey!
joey,"come on in, how are ya?"
joey,can i offer you a drink?
joey,"uh-oh. i hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today i had to open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!"
joey,"hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)"
joey,"yeah, definitely, definitely. ok, what do you wanna see first?"
joey,(looking puzzled and nodding) ok!
joey,"i know, yeah!"
joey,"ok, let me stop you right there. the mets suck, ok? you wanna see the yankees."
joey,"which one, they all suck!"
joey,(looking puzzled) i don't think so.
rachel,(to the receptionist) hi there!
rachel,"oh, hi. i have a massage appointment under rachel green, and here is my gift certificate."
rachel,and... taped back together.
rachel,ok
rachel,"oh no, i'm good, i don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands."
joey,i'll do it!! it'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
phoebe,i hope i win!
monica,"well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?"
joey,i can't tell you what i'm wishing for! else...you know...won't come true!
monica,"right! .. but we ""know"" what you're wishing for!"
joey,can't really say!
monica,"i understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?"
joey,(slightly irritated)i'm not really comfortable with these questions!
phoebe,"one, two, three!"
joey,"i won, hey!"
ross,"you know what, i'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! (rubs lamp, stops because it's very hot) ah!! that thing gets hot!!"
rachel,"you know, ross, just keep making your jokes. how are you gonna feel if we actually do win?"
ross,"uh, you're not gonna win."
rachel,"oh, i know, i know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! and then how you gonna feel? you know, we're gonna be all like ""oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape"" and you're gonna be all like ""oh, i can't guys, i'll meet you guys up there, i gotta gas up the hyundai"""
ross,"(to charlie) so, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave boston, huh?"
ross,"ooh... so sad... still, it can't be easy for you to leave harvard? especially after working alongside a nobel prize winner like albert wintermeyer?"
ross,you... you dated albert wintermeyer?
ross,... and you called him alby!? (laughs) i mean that's like... like calling albert einstein... er... alby...
ross,"eh, you think? i mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!"
ross,"(very interested) oh! like what?! (charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) oh i'm sorry, i don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch ""access hollywood""."
ross,who is intimidating to a guy who won the nobel prize?
ross,(a little suprised) two? wha...? don't tell me you dated benjamin hobart
ross,oh my god! have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the nobel prize?
ross,"oh yeah? no, no nobel prizes for him?"
ross,huh... huh... what a loser! some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)
phoebe,hey ross!
ross,(sarcastically) oh great! after i finish my wine i'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
phoebe,"oh, i should go, too. oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should mike and i just meet you there."
phoebe,mike?? who's mike?
phoebe,"that's right! oh, yeah... well, i've totally forgotten about im! ah! that's-that's... a blast from the past!"
phoebe,"really, it doesn't mean anything. i mean, you know, monica refers to chandler as richard all the time!"
chandler,(upset) she does?
monica,(pinching her) let's get you out of here!! (they go outside)
monica,at least you took me down with you!
phoebe,"i'm sooo sorry!! i just... i keep thinking about mike! i'm crazy about david, and we're having so much fun together. why-why do i miss mike? that's-that's gonna go away, right?"
monica,"i guess, in time."
phoebe,yeah.
monica,"i mean, my feelings for richard are certainly gone."
phoebe,"you just did it again. chandler, your feelings for chandler are certainly gone!"
chandler,i wouldn't read too much into it.
chandler,"david, let me stop you there 'cause i think i see where this is going. i'm not very good at giving advice. so if you want advice, go to ross, monica, or... joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee."
chandler,"seriously, we're gonna do this?"
rachel,no. i was just going to do this myself. (joey makes a sarcastic laugh.)
joey,you're gonna do it?
rachel,yeah...why? you don't think a woman can do this?
joey,oh...women can. you..can't.
rachel,monica...would you please tell joey that he is a pig?
monica,you're a pig. and you can't do this.
rachel,wha!? what!? come on! i found the hardware store all by myself!
joey,the hardware store is right down the street.
rachel,there is a hardware store right down the street?
phoebe,hey you guys! ok..we've got great news.
phoebe,i know it's so exciting! you know i've never lived with a guy before.
monica,"well you know it's just like living with a girl. only they don't steal your makeup. unless...they're playing ""this is what my sister would look like""..(looks at chandler)"
chandler,yeah...she's not so cute.
phoebe,ok...well you put down the toilet seat.
monica,is that a bit you guys do?
phoebe,"(after a pause) unless... maybe it's too crazy about this... alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. you know what? forget what i said."
monica,really? if that's what you want...
phoebe,that was a test and you just failed.
monica,damn it! rookie mistake!
ross,(yelling at chandler) i have sex with dinosaurs??
chandler,i believe i read that somewhere!
ross,"that only is not funny, it's physically impossible! ok? depending on the species i'd have to have a six foot long... (pause) it's not funny!!"
chandler,i respectfully disagree.
ross,i can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
chandler,who cares? nobody reads those things
ross,you'd better hope not because i just read what you put on your page today.
chandler,i don't have a page.
ross,oh oh oh! i respectfully disagree!!
joey,"look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up hugsy) it's okay, emma, you stay asleep. (emma cries)"
rachel,"(threatening joey with a scrunchy): step away from the crib, i have a weapon!"
joey,"yeah, maybe michael jordan will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee!"
chandler,that is so cool. i’ll let monica know.
monica,hello?
chandler,joey just called. he’s got courtside knicks tickets for me and him tomorrow night.
monica,really? but tomorrow night’s the only one i get off from the restaurant. if you go to the game then we won’t have another night together for a week.
chandler,but-t it’s courtside! the cheerleaders are gonna be right in … [mouths last words so monica does not hear them]. that’s not the way to convince you.
monica,"look. i don’t want to be one of those wives that says “you can’t go to the game”, “you have to spend time with me”, so, if you just realize it on your own?"
chandler,i…i…i know. you’re right. i wanna see you too. i’ve just got to figure out a way to tell joey. he’s really looking forward to this.
monica,[on phone] tell him you haven’t seen your wife in a long time. [in apartment] tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. tell him that…what little time that we have is precious.
chandler,"yeah, yeah, yeah. i’ll think of something."
ross,"wow! you look…er…hm……i mean, it’s just the…er…that, that dress! er…"
rachel,i hope the ends of these sentences are good!
ross,"no, no…they’re good. it’s just been so long since i’ve seen you like this. you clean up good!"
rachel,"ahh. [looks down] well, thank you! ha-ha! [ross continues to stare at rachel] okay – stop looking at me like that. the last time that happened [pointing towards ross’s crotch] that happened [pointing at emma]"
ross,"why...why should i? i mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!"
chandler,"you know when ""that's fine"" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!"
ross,no i'm serious. i mean she wants to date people? fine! i don't care but...at least she could have told me. you know
chandler,no no no. good. so you're moving on? do you have any idea where you're moving?
ross,i don't know. i mean i have plenty of opportunity. just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.
chandler,"dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!"
ross,"well, and how about this? there is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental"
chandler,why did i get married?!
joey,hey! let me ask you guys something. i have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks i
phoebe,well it depends.
joey,on...?
phoebe,on how far along he's in the sex change process!
monica,"no i totally disagree. no i think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. such you an actor. not that you need to,"
joey,ok! stop it you guys! stop staring! you're freaking me out!
phoebe,"...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle; and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but i heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, ""merry christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"""
joey,"(impressed) wow, that was great! you really wrote that?"
phoebe,(smiling) uh-huh.
chandler,"(coming from the bedroom) say goodbye elves, i'm off to tulsa."
monica,hey hon? would you help me get the plates down?
chandler,yeah. hey! here's an idea. why don't we use our wedding china today?
monica,"no, i think we should save our china for something really special...like, if the queen of england comes over."
chandler,"honey, she keeps cancelling on us...take the hint!"
monica,what if something gets broken? they're so expensive!
chandler,"what is the point of having them, if we never use them?"
monica,"ok..but if something gets broken, and then the queen comes over..."
chandler,i will explain it to her.
monica,oh yeah! like i'm going to let you talk to the queen.
chandler,hey! this is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
monica,i know!!! my erection is back!
joey,(to gunther who comes over with coffee and a muffin) thank you!
phoebe,"joey, can i have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?"
joey,okay.
joey,": pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry italian?"
phoebe,"i'm sorry, it's just, i'm a little short on cash."
joey,if you want i could loan you some money?
phoebe,"oh no, no, no. i learned never to borrow money from friends. no, that's why richard dreyfuss and i don't speak anymore."
joey,"oh, hey, how about this? wanna be an extra on my show?"
phoebe,you could do that?
joey,"yeah, yeah. the pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need."
phoebe,"oh my god, i'm gonna be on tv!"
joey,"okay, now. i gotta tell you, being on tv isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think."
phoebe,"oh, really?"
joey,no it is awesome!
ross,hi guys.
ross,"so hot, i cried myself to sleep last night."
phoebe,"hey mike, what is the capital of peru?"
phoebe,no. hmm...it starts with a v and end with an x. hopefully with a to in the middle.
phoebe,"(looks relieved) oh, yeah i know. that’s bob."
phoebe,"well not so much a pet, as, you know, an occasionally visitor who i put food out for…you know…kinda like santa…except santa doesn’t poof on a plate of cookies."
phoebe,what are those?
phoebe,"ok fine. if it means that much to you, i’ll get rid of bob."
phoebe,so weird. you think he’s so gross yet you’re willing to eat his crackers. [mike desperately tries to get rid of crackers in his mouth. his uses his hand to clean his tongue.]
rachel,hello
rachel,"gavin, i just want to say thanks you again for watching emma yesterday during the presentation. i really owe you an apology."
monica,what?
phoebe,"still, he had to find out sometime."
chandler,"yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?"
chandler,i'm gonna go tell emma she was an accident. (runs off.)
ross,(mumbling) she doesn't know what to say!
chandler,just give us the cheapest room you have.
chandler,that's insane!
ross,"totally insane. dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves."
chandler,does that room have a closet i can lock him in? (pause) we'll take it.
chandler,"(aside, to ross) what!? they are totally ripping us off!"
ross,"dude, don't worry 'bout it! i know how we can make your money back! this is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! like those apples. instead of taking one, i'm... i take six!"
chandler,"great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!"
ross,"c'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!"
chandler,"dude, you're shaking!"
ross,"i think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?"
rachel,hi!
joey,hey!
rachel,"joey, i gotta tell ya, i've been thinking all day about that scene you did, i mean, you were amazing!"
joey,"oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!"
rachel,"god, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!"
rachel,sure!
phoebe,ok!
rachel,you know that depends on what it is! i've done a lot of stuff.
phoebe,"so what were you doing out there, do you not like charlie?"
rachel,"she's ok, i just don't get a really good vibe from her!"
phoebe,why?
rachel,"i don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! you know, and just swept joey off his feet... i mean, nobody else has a chance!"
phoebe,who else?
rachel,"anybody! you, me, you know, monica's mom..."
phoebe,you like joey?
rachel,"shhhhh! phoebe! all right, look. i have a little thing for him."
phoebe,(whispering) oh my god!
rachel,"it's just physical and i have it totally under control! ok? it's just, when i see them together, sometimes i just get a little jealous!"
phoebe,"uh, wow! isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?"
rachel,"(annoyed) oh, i get it!"
phoebe,"oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right."
rachel,"i know, i know, so it is just not a big deal."
phoebe,"no, i think i can come over. it's saturday, right?"
phoebe,what?
phoebe,why not?
phoebe,you have a... you have a date? with who?
phoebe,(lets go of his hand) you have... have a girlfriend?
phoebe,for how long?
phoebe,"three months? okay... this is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?"
phoebe,"oh, okay... good. you do that. and then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you."
phoebe,"you know what, we're gonna have sex. let's just leave it there."
ross,"right, i'm gonna go talk to joey. i think this is the right time. he's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says ""duty free""."
rachel,ross is coming over. i think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
joey,i guess so. i'm just... really nervous.
rachel,"okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner."
joey,ooh...
rachel,still nervous?
rachel,(imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors.
rachel,alright-y then.
phoebe,"ok. do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (she sees rachel) oh, no, no! listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?"
phoebe,but that woman can't know i work here. she's a friend of mine and i made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
phoebe,'cause it's good money! but that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
phoebe,"(watching around and whispering) ok, are they listening?"
joey,ross!
ross,hi!
joey,i need to talk to you about charlie.
ross,"(annoyed) oh, do you, do you really?"
joey,"yeah, i'm... i'm kind of having a little problem."
ross,"look, if you don't know what the word ""acrimonious"" means, just don't use it!"
joey,"no, look, you know charlie, right? she's cool, she's funny, her body is soo..."
ross,get to the problem!
ross,"ok, i've heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that."
chandler,"i can see the headline now: ""lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm""."
ross,why would i eat my own arm?
chandler,"well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want."
monica,"you know what, ross? i'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you."
ross,why?
monica,"because i know that you think the lottery is ""boohaki"" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. and you're my brother, and i want you to be a part of this."
ross,"you don't have to do that, i'll pay for myself. but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! come here (they kiss and hug)"
phoebe,get a room!
chandler,"ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?"
ross,"i don't know, probably just invest it."
chandler,ooh! calm down ...
joey,"seriously, that's your fantasy? to invest it?"
ross,"oh, i'm sorry, did i say ""invest it""? i meant ""be cool and piss it all away"" (joey and chandler pleased)"
joey,"ooh, ooh, i know! we should pool all own money and buy the knicks!"
rachel,i don't really care about the knicks.
phoebe,"oh, what's the matter?"
ross,"she... she only dates geniuses and nobel prize winners. oh my god, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, i put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth."
rachel,i always loved that!!
ross,"of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! (rachel nods) man, i can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my god!"
phoebe,worse?
ross,"oh much, much worse. i did my impression of joan rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) ""can we walk""? (phoebe starts laughing) oh, you... you like that?"
phoebe,(still laughing) no. (points to rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)
ross,what? (turns around to look at rachel)
rachel,come on! i think this is funny! (ross leaves)
chandler,"(to himself) oh yes, god yes!!"
chandler,i... i don't know... you seem lovely.
joey,"hey ross, this is one of my co-stars, dirk. (to dirk) dirk, this is my good friend ross. (ross and dirk shake hands)"
ross,nice to meet you.
ross,"oh, i'm no actor, i'm a professor of palaeontology."
joey,it's a science.
joey,"hey ross, listen, dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or..."
chandler,"oh, because his penis was too big. (he notices that david is not amused) oh, i'm sorry, that's the kind of thing i do. (pause) they broke up because mike didn't want to get married. hey, what if you just let phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?"
chandler,what?
chandler,i didn't mean now...
chandler,"well, you're welcome! glad i could help."
chandler,"david, i'm pretending to read here!!"
joey,yeah! how you doin'? yeah alright!
joey,"hey, hey! you said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?"
joey,you really should have been more clear about that!
ross,hey!
joey,hey!
ross,(excited) you're never going to guess who i just saw downstairs!
joey,oh! ah! eh... britney spears!?
phoebe,uh huh...we're playing you two.
monica,we don't do that! tell her we don't do that!
chandler,yes dear.
ross,i can't believe you guys are moving in together. that's..that's great! i mean...i'm happy for you guys..
monica,i hear wedding bells.
phoebe,monica slow down! ok? i'm just excited to be living with him. you know i mean..i don't know..can i see someday being married to mike? sure! yeah..you know..i can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. but do i want that house in connecticut...you know..near the good schools where mike and i can send sophie and mike junior.. oh my god i do.
ross,phoebe...i had no idea you were so conventional.
phoebe,i know! i guess i am! oh my god! load up the volvo i want to be a soccer mom!
phoebe,yeah! you bet roomy!
monica,don't you mean..groomy?
phoebe,oh please...these guys...we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns. (mike seems to gag a little...and laughs nervously. they begin to leave. phoebe bolts back)
phoebe,china patterns!!!!!
rachel,this is easy...can't do this! (moves away...and finds her sweater sleeve stuck to the drawer)
rachel,oh! wow! seriously i can't do this. (fiddles more)
chandler,hey joe!
joey,hey!
joey,"it's okay, it's okay rach, it's me. put down the scrunchy."
rachel,what are you doing?
joey,"well, i heard emma stirring, so i came to make sure she could reach hugsy."
rachel,"oh, oh thanks. alright well, now that i'm up i'm going to go to the bathroom."
joey,(placing hugsy back in the crib) there you go sweetie... (to emma) this isn't over.
monica,"alright, wait a second, why would ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... (reads from the screen) ""gay as the day is long""?"
chandler,because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
monica,but that's clearly a joke. this could easily be true. (phone rings)
chandler,would you get that please? people have been calling to congratulate me all day.
monica,"(on the phone) hello? no, he's not here. yeah, this is his wife. yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. i guess i should have known. yeah, i mean, he just kept making me watch moulin rouge."
chandler,"hang up, hang up. and that was a great movie! (monica hangs up) i'm so gonna get back at ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something)."
monica,what are you doing?
chandler,"oh, you'll see my friend."
ross,(visibly upset) i'm dead?
chandler,(faking sympathy) and so young.
ross,posting that i died? that really isn't funny.
chandler,"(picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog in his throat) hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog in his throat when he speaks again) hello?"
monica,"(in her apartment, screaming) i love my new job!"
chandler,"honey, you're screaming."
monica,you bet your ass i am! i just had the best first day ever! the kitchen: twice as big as allessandro's.
chandler,"(yawning) oh, that's great."
monica,"yeah, a-a-and clean. not just health department clean... monica clean."
chandler,(clearly not so interested) awesome.
monica,"oh, and the people are so nice. there's this one guy, geoffrey, he's the maitre d., chandler, you will love him. he is without a doubt, the funniest guy i have ever met. (chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)"
ross,"oh, right! [looking away]"
ross,"so, are you. ah! are you excited about your…er…first night away from emma?"
rachel,"yeah! phoebe and i are gonna have so much fun! thank you for watching the baby, by the way."
ross,"oh, it’s fine. actually, i…i invited mike over"
rachel,phoebe’s mike?
ross,yeah.
rachel,i didn’t know that you guys hung out.
ross,"we don’t. but, i thought that it would be nice to get to know him. you know? we have a little dinner, drinks, conversation."
rachel,awww. that’s so cute! ross and mike’s first date! [beat] is that going to be awkward? what are you guys gonna talk about?
ross,"well, but, you know, we have a lot in common, you know, erm…he plays the piano, i played keyboards in college, or, he’s been divorced, i have…some…experience in that area"
rachel,yeah?
phoebe,hi!
phoebe,"ooh. you’re first night out, indeed!"
rachel,"okay, so now i think emma is properly down for the night but if you need anything ross…[pointing finger into his chest]"
ross,"rach, rach, rach: we’ll be fine. you go have fun."
rachel,okay. you too. and i hope you score.
rachel,bye [to mike]
phoebe,"oh hey you guys, i couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner thursday night instead."
joey,thursday? but that's halloween.
phoebe,so?
joey,"[it's just] so spooky, that's all."
ross,"so, so, is mike coming to dinner?"
phoebe,"no! it's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. uch, i get mad at him, but i think it's a little to soon to show my true colors."
rachel,"pheebs, i would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch emma. (to ross:) which one of us should go to dinner?"
phoebe,"oh, rachel!"
ross,"actually, um, i was thinking maybe both of us could go."
phoebe,"oh, yay!"
ross,"thanks, i put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift."
phoebe,your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
joey,oh man! i have to get those done too?!
phoebe,wow! talking about high maintenance
joey,hey hey! you dye your hair!
phoebe,i'm a woman!
joey,arghhh! double standards!
phoebe,"oh before i forget, are you coming to mike's piano bar tonight?"
monica,only if i don't have to get up and sing.
phoebe,"but everybody sings. it's so much fun! last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out"
monica,"it's just, i'm not good at singing."
phoebe,oh! what's the matter? are you scared? you're afraid i'm a better singer? you're afraid i'm gonna beat you at singing?
monica,"no no, it's not working on me. wow! i must be growing up!"
phoebe,ok fine! please come and support mike. you don't have to sing.
monica,so i don't have to sing and i can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
phoebe,while drinking...
monica,i'm there!
rachel,hi guys! listen i really need your help. i think i did something really stupid.
monica,i can't believe you're not gonna be here for christmas.
ross,you're really not coming back?
chandler,"yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. if i don't get it done, i'll be fired."
monica,"it's so unfair, you don't even like your job!"
chandler,"so, who does?"
phoebe,"oh, i like my job."
joey,i *love* my job.
rachel,"yeah, i can't *wait* to go back to work."
ross,i can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
chandler,i'm sorry i won't be here.
monica,"it's just... it's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, i understand."
chandler,thanks. (they kiss) i'll see you new year's day.
monica,(shocked) you're not gonna be here new year's eve??
chandler,did i not mention that?
monica,no!
chandler,"(thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming:) ...and to all a good night! (and runs out of the apartment)"
joey,wow the parade is really good this year/man those horses can crap! [looks sideways at the tv in disgust]
chandler,muskogee? that's like four hours from tulsa! woo hoo!
joey,oh my god!!
chandler,aren't you one of the stars of popular daytime soap days of our lives?
joey,yeah!! i forgot i'm supposed to be there! i can't believe i forgot! i usually write stuff like this down on my arm!
joey,oh! stupid long sleeves!
chandler,what are you going to do?
joey,"(sighs) i guess i'm going to come up with a really good reason why i wasn't there! the producer is going to be so mad at me...he sat us all down yesterday and said everyone has to be there six am sharp, that means you tribbiani! (shrugs) like i was some kind of idiot!"
chandler,"well, you proved them wrong."
joey,yeah...
rachel,oh emma...this is your first thanksgiving...what are you thankful for? mommy's boobies?
ross,alot of people are thankful for those!
rachel,who is it?
rachel,hide my rings...
rachel,hey amy!! happy thanksgiving!
rachel,erm...hi! (opens arms wide in an embrace)
phoebe,"wow! hey, why are you all dressed up?"
ross,rachel and i are bringing emma to ralph lauren today to introduce her to everyone. doesn't she look cute?
joey,she sure does. why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
rachel,"well, because if one more person says ""what a cute little boy"" i'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!"
ross,"i think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? she's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and a-line skirts. can i get a blue bow?"
monica,"(flipping through bunch of folders as chandler enters from bathroom) okay, i have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision."
chandler,how long was i in there?
monica,okay. let us start with the a's. advertising.
chandler,wait. advertising! that's a great idea!
monica,don't you want to look through the rest?
chandler,"i don't think i have to hear the rest. advertising makes perfect sense. sorry you had to waste all this time, though."
monica,"you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? ooh, now i get to use my shredder!"
rachel,"well when we first met, you know i thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious."
rachel,"no i just mean that you know, first impression don’t mean anything. and i think you are a really good guy. and i’m sorry that i misjudge you."
rachel,hey (turning around to place her documents)
rachel,"you know what, hey, new day, new leave, i am just really really happy(she turned around to see gaving looking at heather’s butt.)…i’m sorry. obviously heather’s ass has something more important to say so i will just wait till it’s finish."
rachel,i was giving you an apology and you were totally checking her out.
rachel,"ow, you are really, really a creep."
rachel,why do you even care if i was looking at her? are you jealous?
rachel,"oh yeah! (sarcastic) i’m jealous. oh gavin, please, please look at my ass."
rachel,stop looking at my ass.
rachel,"i mean i just think you are totally inappropriate, ok. this is a working environment. she is your subordinate"
rachel,"that is totally different for two reasons. one. i didn’t know that you knew that… and two, i wasn’t some creep staring at his ass. we had a…we had a deep, meaningful relationship."
rachel,"it was…(staring at the air, thinking)…oh my god…he didn’t…he didn’t have a last name. it was just…just tag. you know, like cher, or you know…moses."
rachel,"(turned around, looking angry, mumbling) oh what are you his boyfriend..."
joey,"ow, i'm just going over the script now! you wanna read lines with me?"
rachel,"me? oh, no, i am not an actress."
joey,"oh, all right, i can ask monica."
rachel,"oh screw her, that part is mine!"
joey,"right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here."
rachel,"okay. (pause).(acting) hello drake, i'm surprised to see you here."
rachel,(pause) kiss me.
joey,what?
rachel,kiss me.
joey,"ah, rach, it doesn't say that!"
rachel,"no, i'm saying..."
joey,"but, but.."
rachel,just... don't talk... (she kisses him)
rachel,"(waking up) ehhh, aw! (pause). well, that's new!"
ross,"(on the phone) hi, this is ross geller in suite 206. it seems you forgot a couple of things. could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) thank you! ok. toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and i feel like i am forgetting something... is there anything else you have that i haven't asked for already? (pause) yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons."
phoebe,yeah.
rachel,so can we keep this between us?
phoebe,sure!
rachel,"ok, great, because i gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!"
phoebe,oh.
phoebe,any chance charlie has a deaf twin?
monica,hi honey!
chandler,"hey! look i brought a friend for dinner, this is zack, from work!"
monica,"oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, zack!"
chandler,"you guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! you're both polite! (pause) go to have a seat zack, and i'll get you a beer."
monica,i got it.
chandler,"(to mon) so, zack's pretty nice, uh?"
monica,"yeah, i guess."
chandler,"so, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!"
joey,i'm gonna get the lasagna.
ross,hey rach...
rachel,yeah!
ross,do you mind if i sit here for a sec.?
rachel,"yeah, yeah sure! yeah! (mouths ""good luck"" to joey and gets up from her seat)"
ross,hey!
joey,hey!
ross,"so, i uhm... kinda need to talk to you about charlie."
joey,yeah?
ross,"okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... well, charlie and i were talking, and..., well..."
joey,you kissed.
ross,wha... (gasps) what? what would give you that idea?
joey,i saw you.
ross,"yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay."
joey,"ross, ross, ross... it's okay."
ross,what?
joey,yes. it's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls i've ever dated! combined! i don't want her to think i'm stupid!
ross,(looking down) are you wearing two belts?
joey,"(checking) eh, what do you know!"
ross,you were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
joey,"right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and i don't know how to talk about that stuff. you gotta help me out!"
ross,"you know, i really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship."
joey,"please, c'mon, you're the smartest person i know and i really like this girl, ok, i don't wanna lose her."
ross,(after a short hesitation) fine.
joey,thanks.
ross,"ok. let's see. oh, you should take her to the met!"
joey,the metsss!
ross,"oh, no! the met! the metropolitan museum of art."
joey,"(realizing) oh, that's what she meant! (pause) you know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the muse! you know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!"
ross,"yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!"
joey,"oh, you will when i pick you as starting forward."
rachel,(touched) you would do that? i never get picked!
chandler,"you know, i'm not sure a sports team is the way to go."
joey,you're not gonna let me buy the knicks?? i can't believe you're taking this away from me!
chandler,"you're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds."
ross,"(to rachel) uh, how long until they announce the numbers, mommy?"
chandler,(looks around) i'll take this one too (to ross) uh ... mommy?
ross,"oh, i've gotten into the habit of calling rachel ""mommy"" when we're around emma. which i now realize we are not ..."
rachel,i'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
ross,"although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me ""daddy"" too."
phoebe,"oooh, i like that, ""daddy"" (in a sexy tone)"
ross,i ... i was just talking about rachel.
phoebe,"(still in sexy tone) oooh, is daddy getting angry? is daddy gonna spank me?"
ross,(tries to be sexy too) well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. (stops) no i can't.
chandler,"hello? hello? oh, hey charlie. did anybody else hear? ... what? susan got it?? how? oh man, i would have slept with him!! .. alright, bye. (hangs up)"
ross,"oh, well no, but i mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys."
ross,i'd lead with that.
monica,"that's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so)."
joey,monica!
monica,"don't worry joe, i won't come next year!"
joey,(to rachel) what have you got there?
ross,just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
joey,"ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) damn, that's a lot of guys! are you a little slutty?"
rachel,(drunken voice) i think i am.
joey,"(browsing the tissues) let me see if i approve any of these clowns. this guy wears a rug (discards one). this guy's canadian (discards another). and this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and i don't feel any different."
joey,"(discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass..."
rachel,"(picking up the tissues) why, why, what's wrong with these guys?"
joey,"nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best."
rachel,"joey, you're so sweet."
joey,"that's true. but you know what, it doesn't matter because i already know who you're gonna go home with tonight."
ross,"yeah, she never misses these conferences! (then to charlie) no, i just saw dr. kenneth schwartz!"
ross,yeah... what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz?
joey,"you could say: ""hey kenny, how come you're not britney spears?"" (looks at ross matter-of-factly)"
ross,(to charlie) ready to go?
joey,wha...? you're gonna go now? i thought we could hang out?
ross,yeah.
joey,(smiling) will you wear a thong?
joey,oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
ross,"(a little embarassed by their conversation) i'm good, i have dinner plans (moves away from them)."
joey,"yeah, yeah. i've got tons of stuff i could do. i'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming..."
ross,"uh, joe, have you looked outside?"
joey,"no, why?"
joey,oh man!
chandler,listen er..i need to ask you a favor but you can't tell monica anything about it.
joey,i thought you didn't have secrets from monica.
chandler,and that would have made the official party line. (joey nods) monica and i are having a little financial trouble.
joey,yeah..i know.
chandler,what? what do you mean you know?
joey,er....i just figured it out! you know..i mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
chandler,oh! right.
chandler,"anyway, er... i need to borrow some money."
joey,oh! sure! how much? two thousand dollars?
chandler,yes! two thousand dollars exactly! how do you know that! (joey begins writing a cheque)
joey,er....well i...know how much you used to make...and i know how much your rent is. (shrugs)
chandler,oh ok.
joey,er...kind of..
chandler,i can't believe her! did she tell you we were having money problems?
joey,oh no no no no no...it wasn't...it wasn't because of your money problems...it was for something...for her.
chandler,"well, how you died was funny."
ross,"oh please, hit by a blimp?"
chandler,it kills over one americans every year.
ross,"unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think i'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. you're messing with people's feelings here."
chandler,you wanna talk about people's feelings? you should have heard how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i wouldn't be able to go with him to key west!
ross,"you've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause i'm on my way to buy some photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. that's right! your coming out is about to get real graphic."
phoebe,"god, i wish mike were here."
monica,okay if mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
monica,"what are you, animals? it's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!"
phoebe,"i gotta call him. just to talk to him, there's no harm in that."
monica,"phoebe, that's how it starts. i don't need to eat the cake, i'll just smell the icing... why don't i just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. and next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. phoebe, honey, i know this is hard. look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. and if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. i know that's not what you want. (pause) give me your phone."
phoebe,here.
monica,and now your cell.
phoebe,"okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to monica)"
phoebe,"i know! (phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want to let go of mike's hand. she tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)"
phoebe,"yeah, i kinda do. (mike lets go of her hand) well, how's this? (she takes mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. after that, they hold hands again. joey now enters, and sees the two sitting on the couch, holding hands.)"
joey,"(in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (phoebe and mike, embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) have you not talked about it yet? (they say nothing now, but smile) am i making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to mike) if you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)"
phoebe,i'm sorry... i'm sorry. it's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
phoebe,"(in a flash she answers) maybe not, is it?"
phoebe,"(impatient) i know mike, why don't you keep digging?"
phoebe,"oh, it's a key. to be honest, i think i'd prefer the five dollars."
phoebe,"(really surprised) oh wow, ooh! ooh, big step for phoebe and mike."
phoebe,"oh no, i want to."
phoebe,"yeah... ooh... wow... even started to think i'd never meet someone that, you know, i wanted to... do this with. here you go. (both phoebe and mike look really proud.)"
phoebe,it really is.
joey,"(sitting at his table) oh, i know it... it is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with his own keys, phoebe looks at him in a ""yeah, yeah, yeah"" way.)"
rachel,"so i don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that emma could get a chance to know her."
ross,"so, welcome!"
ross,i’ve got bottled breast milk.
ross,okay
ross,"so, phoebe tells me you, er, play the piano?"
ross,"you, you know? i used to play the keyboards in college."
ross,no
ross,"erm, you know, i’m divorced. er, phoebe said you’ve been divorced."
ross,"[lost for words] yeah, er… that’s okay. we’ll talk about something else."
ross,yeah.
ross,ah!
ross,"well, he and i would probably have a lot to talk about."
monica,hi! [surprised]
chandler,hey!
phoebe,oh hey ross oh i'm so glad someone's here could you zip me up?
ross,sure.
phoebe,thank you can you believe no one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me.
ross,"people (shakes head, they sit) so why you all dressed up."
phoebe,oh umm mike's picking me up for a date.
ross,"oh yea now um how is that going, is it getting serious?"
phoebe,"oh i dunno i dunno, you know i mean i like him but am i ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market."
ross,"you know i really admire your whole dating attitude, it's so healthy i'm always like is this moving to fast? is this moving to slow? where's this going?"
phoebe,yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.
ross,"but you, your so much better off you just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious."
phoebe,"i wouldn't say never, you know there's that guy (pause) well what about (pause) ok well there's gotta be someone."
phoebe,"alright, okay, so we can all go now. that is fun. hey, you know what? we all haven't been together the six of us in such a long time."
monica,what are you talking about? we're all together right now.
rachel,"um, mon, chandler's not here."
monica,"oh, dear god!"
chandler,"good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. now, before we get started, are there any questions? (colleague raises hand) yes, ken is it?"
chandler,"(laughs) well, don't believe everything you hear, ken. (both turning away to files) but yeah, that's true. alright, let's get started, by take a look at last quarter's figures. (the female next to chandler starts smoking, towards heross:) ah, claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?"
chandler,"no, no, no-no-no. i smoked for years, then i quit. right now, i can't remember why. (to everyone:) you're not allowed to smoke in this office. not right?"
chandler,"alright, lo...look. i don't smoke anymore. but if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. (everyone lits) so you all smoke then? that's almost rude, that i'm not."
chandler,"(loud) ken, please! no, i can't, i can't smoke. if i smoke, my wife would kill me."
chandler,"i always liked you, ken. (takes a cig)"
phoebe,"(from outside) trick or treat! (it's obviously halloween eve, the night of her birthday dinner.)"
monica,(opening the door) hey!
phoebe,"ooh, and treat it is. (monica's breasts.)"
phoebe,well yes rachel but you got something so beautiful out there
rachel,no not that. i kissed gavin last night.
phoebe,oh my god.
monica,you kissed him?
rachel,"yeah. it was after the party, we were on the balcony and..."
monica,wait wait wait. i was at home the whole time. how did i missed that?
phoebe,"it was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper."
monica,oh yeah...so how did you end up kissing?
rachel,"you know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf..."
monica,i thought you hated him?
rachel,"you know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!"
monica,so are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
rachel,"i don't know. it's so complicated. i work with this guy, you know, i have the baby, and i have ross, and i just...i don't"
monica,"sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to gavin, and you definitely should talk to ross"
rachel,or...i could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
phoebe,"wow! five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!"
chandler,"all right everybody, i know that it's christmas eve and you'd rather be with your familys, but there's *no* call (he takes it off) for writing ""screw you, mr. bing!"" on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) -- by the way, you can all call me chandler."
chandler,hey. where've you been?
chandler,"(to the others) you hear that? you may not be with your familys, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here."
chandler,"y'know what, i know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) i had a little talk with the boys in new york, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little christmas bonus may be in order."
chandler,"well, that's like money in your pocket! - alright look, you want me to say it? this sucks. being here sucks! this work sucks!"
chandler,"i'm sorry. hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your familys tonight. i have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. and then tomorrow morning, you get to have christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to."
chandler,"haha, no thanks!"
chandler,"oh, thanks! i'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker."
chandler,"typical christmas-y stuff, you know? our holidays are pretty traditional..."
phoebe,"so here is a, a very special holiday song that i wrote for some very important people to me."
rachel,"okay, pheebs, you look in the kitchen, i will look in the back closet."
rachel,i haven't seen you in like a year!
rachel,oh...me too! erm..i had a baby...
rachel,"oh..yeah? well, unless you pushed a desk of your vagina, not the same thing."
rachel,er..it's emma[emphasizing on emma]
ross,hey amy.
rachel,"oh amy, you remember ross."
ross,that was me. [rachel laughs in her throat]
ross,still me.
monica,careful. careful.. careful!
chandler,"i'll tell you what. for the rest of our lives, i'll be careful, until told otherwise."
chandler,wait a minute. this isn't the china we picked out...
monica,i know! after you left the store i chose different ones.
chandler,why?
chandler,"i mean, i can write slogans. i mean, how hard can it be, right? ""cheese. it's milk that you chew."" ""crackers. because your cheese needs a buddy."" ""a grape. because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"""
monica,"i got one. ""socks. because your family's feet deserve the best."""
chandler,honey? leave it to the pros.
monica,i actually know someone in advertising. i grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. maybe i can get him to meet you? give me the phone.
chandler,"""the phone. bringing you closer to people...who have phones."""
monica,"""marriage. it's not for everybody."""
rachel,that went well. almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
ross,"yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread."
rachel,i'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . (to the guy behind her desk) who the hell are you!?
rachel,i'm the hell person whose office this is!
ross,"good one, rach."
rachel,excuse me?
phoebe,"joey, look at me! i'm a nurse!"
joey,"man, i wish i had a nanny like you."
joey,sure!
monica,would you stop staring at her?
chandler,(staring at molly) i wasn’t staring. i was leering.
monica,what’s the big deal with her? maybe she’s attractive in an obvious kind of way.
ross,"yeah, obvious beauty is the worst. you know, when it’s right there in your face. me, i like i have to work to find someone attractive, makes me feel like i earned it."
chandler,so joey is doing alright with her (ross quickly turns to see).
monica,yeah. hey that’s was nice to see you guys back off and let joey get the girl for once.
ross,ok. i will be home right after work. ok. bye emmaemmaema. i lovedadylove you. (ross kisses emma.)
monica,they would like me to talk to you about the baby-talk. (waving her finger)it’s not so good.
ross,hey listen. joey. about molly. i would really prefer if you didn’t go after her.
joey,why not?
ross,"because it’s took us months to find a good nanny. and i wouldn’t want anything to, you know, drive her away."
joey,"so, what? you think i’m just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (expression changed from confused to ‘enlightened’) yeah that sounds about right…"
ross,what did you get?
chandler,usa today
ross,"nice, put it with the others."
chandler,and i also got... two more apples.
ross,"we are four short of a bush-o (pause). god i feel so alive, i love being in the country!"
chandler,i also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
ross,"oh, that's not cool."
ross,"no, chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. for example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. (pause) now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) i wish i'd thought this through."
chandler,"i think i know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that."
ross,"not my first time in a hotel, my friend."
chandler,"ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?"
ross,"no, no, no, you can't take the remote control!"
chandler,"yes, but the batteries..."
chandler,"thank you, thank you very much!"
ross,let's celebrate with some maple candy!
monica,(turns around and she's quite shocked) excuse me?
chandler,"well, we're talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy! i mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, i mean, he is ""spermtastic""!"
monica,"chandler, this is crazy! what did you even say to him! ""come up, meet my wife! give us your sperm""!"
chandler,"no, i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! i mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out."
monica,chandler!
chandler,"i'm telling you, he's great! i mean, even if my sperm worked fine, i'd think he'd be the way to go!"
monica,i'm not going to be a part of this! you can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
chandler,ok!
monica,uh!
chandler,(bringing the beer to zack) zack!
monica,"tell me about yourself, zack!"
rachel,"oh, god, do you think she heard? it would be so bad if she heard!"
phoebe,"well, maybe she didn't hear! ok i'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and i'll talk and see if you can hear me."
joey,"it's okay. you know, i totally understand, alright? you guys, make way more sense than her and i ever did, you know. and... i want you to be happy."
ross,are you serious?
joey,yeah... now i have something...
ross,"i am speachless... i mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. i mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?"
joey,oh... uh... look... before you...
ross,"no, i mean it. you are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous..."
joey,"i am those things, yeah."
ross,"you know what? i know chandler longer, so i always think of him as my best friend, but now... i may have to rethink some stuff..."
joey,dude!
ross,"hey, if there is ever, anything i can do for you..."
joey,i can't think of anything.
ross,thanks!
joey,yeah.
rachel,so hi!
ross,hi!
joey,"ok, all right, so i'll take her to the met."
ross,"yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on madison avenue. you know what? she loves architecture, you know what you should do? you should take a walk down fifth to the saint patrick's cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love."
joey,"geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!"
ross,but i'm not! (pause). you know what if you're in the mood for thai food...
joey,"whoa, whoa, whoa! slow down, you go way too fast. ok? just go back to the met, ok?"
ross,ok.
joey,you got to tell me exactly what to do there.
ross,"ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. ancient egypt, mesopotamia, up to the byzantine empire."
joey,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! so, i walk in the door and make the right (and he bends his arm to the left. ross then bends joey's arm to the right and joey nods)"
chandler,i have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) how do i know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
monica,"because, honey, i mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that."
chandler,"deposit my specimen? you know, usually i have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. thanks, got it."
monica,"hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?"
chandler,"yeah, i guess!"
joey,"dude, i'm sorry. but hey, there's one spot left, right?"
chandler,"well no, charlie's gonna get that."
monica,"hey, don't say that! you got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!"
chandler,he's the boss's son.
monica,"come on, lottery!! (everybody cheers)"
rachel,"ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes."
monica,"ok, here we go. we need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. so does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? (doesn't let them answer) ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first."
rachel,"ooh, i have another idea!"
monica,"i'm sorry, idea time is over."
phoebe,"ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?"
monica,yeah.
chandler,what about the ones you have on the nightstand?
monica,there are no tickets on the nightstand!
chandler,"yes there are, i just saw them a few minutes ago."
rachel,who (looks around)?
joey,me.
rachel,(surprised) what? (with a nervous smile) really?
joey,"yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!"
rachel,"oh! screw it, i didn't get it! (they high-five)"
joey,gotcha.
rachel,"oh, very funny... joey."
chandler,"(to monica) so, how did you enjoy the play?"
monica,"oh my god, honey, i'm so so so so so sorry."
chandler,well you should be. you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
monica,you really liked it?
chandler,"oh yeah! i mean at first i hated it, but why wouldn't i, because as a man i've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) but after chapter 16: ""fat, single and ready to mingle"", i was uplifted."
monica,oh really!
chandler,"oh yeah, i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! tell me, tell me about your first period!"
joey,"i wasn't gonna swim, i was gonna dig a hole! (removes a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his backpack)"
monica,wow! that mike thing was interesting! i don't know what's gonna happen with phoebe and david.
chandler,"(smiling cheekily) i do! want a hint? huh? ""i do"" (monica looks confused, so chandler repeats) ""i do""."
monica,"ok, i'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee."
chandler,david is going to propose to phoebe.
monica,what? (looks very shocked) why?
chandler,"be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married."
monica,"chandler, we have talked about this. you are not supposed to give people advice! now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?"
chandler,"i did! a penis one! look, just so i know, what was so wrong about what i said?"
monica,"they've only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike! she'll say ""no"", david's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again."
chandler,"man, that's some bad advice!"
joey,oh! hey! thank god you guys are here!
rachel,hey! hey what's going on?
joey,"everything is upside down here! it rains all day long, nobody watches tv and ross is famous!"
rachel,"alright, i don't wanna alarm anybody, but monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!"
monica,"ok! when i go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!"
chandler,what?
joey,something personal.
chandler,what would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
joey,boob job.
monica,i don't want her to get a boob job! that's crazy!
joey,well it's...it's not that crazy. ok? making them smaller. that would be crazy.
phoebe,oh! alright. well i think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomie.
phoebe,oh no! no no! not at all. we're just moving in right now. see where it goes.
phoebe,what do you mean?
phoebe,oh. wow.
phoebe,was it really that bad?
phoebe,ok..well that's bad...but don't you think it might be different with someone else? perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. except for once in the ocean.
phoebe,but it's just..
monica,this is your cellphone?
phoebe,yes.
monica,this is your current cellphone?
phoebe,"yes, it reminds me of a simpler time."
monica,"phoebe, where's your purse?"
monica,"no, no! give it to me!"
phoebe,you can't have it.
monica,give it to me!
phoebe,no (tucks it in her pants)
monica,i'll go in there.
phoebe,(disbelievingly) oh yeah.
monica,phoebe come here
monica,haha!
phoebe,damn you monica geller hyphen bing!
joey,"hey, look who's here! it's joey, and he brought home a friend."
rachel,"that's great, great. so do you have any questions for us?"
rachel,allright. well thank you so much for coming... (they're standing up and make their way to the door)
ross,thank you.
rachel,really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
ross,"boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that."
rachel,okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face while ross crumples up the application form) wow! we're never gonna find a nanny.
ross,"oh, come on rach, we will. i promise. we have more interviews (they sit down and rachel sighs) and worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with."
rachel,"(indignant) what, the blonde with no bra?"
ross,"she was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but then gets a ""gotcha"" expression on his face... there's knocking at the door.) just a sec.! okay, okay. this one's name is sandy. she's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years."
rachel,okay... (ross opens the door.)
ross,and she's a little mannish...
phoebe,(gasps) oh my god! david!
phoebe,"(excited) no! it's a great time, come in...! wow, hi... oh my gosh! what are you doing here? are you back from minsk?"
monica,welcome home.
chandler,"oh, well, look at you!"
monica,what do you think?
chandler,"well, it’s great, well, i’m just wearing the same thing underneath! look at you."
joey,"ooh. hey, how come you door’s locked?"
monica,just a second.
chandler,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. joey can’t know that i am here."
monica,why not?
chandler,"because i didn’t know how to tell him that i couldn’t go to the knicks game, so i just told him that i had to stay in tulsa."
monica,so you lied to him?
chandler,"eh, it is always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion. [monica glares at him] except with you!"
joey,hey! open the door! what’s going on?
monica,hi!
ross,there isn't that's what i'm saying. (all happy)
phoebe,oh my god you're right.
ross,i know and yet here you are all ready for the next date.
phoebe,"i can't believe i never realized this before, i'm in my thirty's and never been in a long-term relationship oh my god (starts crying) what's wrong with me."
ross,"no, no, no there's nothing wrong with you i mean you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway."
phoebe,i wanna get married (grabs a tissue)
ross,"please don't cry because of me pheebs i don't know what i'm talking about, i've been divorced three times."
phoebe,"least you've been married, oh my god! i wanna trade lives with ross (cries more)"
phoebe,"nothing, i'm excited about our date, mike this is ross geller this is mike haaaaa (starts crying)"
ross,i'm sorry i didn't catch…
ross,oh ross geller
phoebe,uh huh (terns to ross) how do i look (all her make up has gone everywhere)
ross,do you have a compact in your purse?
phoebe,(goes to cry) no
monica,hmhmm. (ties up)
phoebe,"wow, so glad i changed. almost weared my ??? outfit that can't contain my breasts."
monica,"this is not, what i'm wearing. i'm ovulating and chandler's gonna be home any minute, so i thought we would try before dinner."
phoebe,"ohh. oh wait! (jis) you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you?"
monica,"believe me, chandler and i have not seen each other in over a week. we'll probably be the first ones there."
phoebe,"'kay, see you there. happy humping! (outside meeting chandler.) hey...hey! oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? oh my god, don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?"
chandler,"actually, in oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people."
phoebe,you smoked!
chandler,"no! i just happened t'do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. for example, in hawaii cigarettes are called leyhallalookoos."
phoebe,"(smells at him) chandler, you stink of cigarettes."
chandler,"uch, do you think, monica is gonna be able smell it?"
phoebe,are you kidding? the woman has the nose of a bloodhound ... and the breasts of a great goddess.
chandler,pheebs?
phoebe,(embarrassed) i'm gonna go. (leaves to stairs)
joey,hey. i'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
joey,chandler bing.
joey,ok thanks.
joey,thanks. do you get a lot of guys in here?
joey,oh good...
joey,all right let's just do this.
joey,please i have an extremely high threshold...holly mother of god! my face! my face!! i'm all right! i'm all right!
chandler,hey it's the most eligible man in ny. how's the moving on going?
ross,not well. i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
chandler,"well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. you know i mean think about it. single white male, divorced three times,"
ross,that's funny...do you think you'll ever work again?
chandler,what are doing? you know i can only dish it out!
ross,i can't believe rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me
chandler,"i can save you time ladies, i'm right here."
phoebe,"yeah, chandler why don't you take a walk? this doesn't concern you."
rachel,we are looking for our christmas presents from monica.
chandler,what? that's terrible!
phoebe,"no-no, we do it every year!"
chandler,"oh well, that, that makes it not terrible."
phoebe,"no, yeah, we never find them! she's always best at us, that wily... minx."
rachel,"don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to joey's and search, ok?"
chandler,"no not okay, you can't look for monica's presents!"
phoebe,"oh no, we have to!"
chandler,"no, you don't have to, and you can't because i, i live here too."
phoebe,"well then, you should look with us."
chandler,why?
rachel,"chandler, aren't you worried about what to get monica for christmas?"
chandler,"no, i have a great idea for a present for her."
phoebe,"oh, that's it? (mimics chandler) a great idea! oh yeah."
monica,"well, no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me."
chandler,oh suddenly flowers are feminine?
phoebe,hey everybody! happy thanksgiving!
joey,"phoebs! [does a ""come here!"" action]"
phoebe,"hey what's going on, joe?"
joey,"listen, i...i...i... need a good lie."
phoebe,oh...ok..how about the whole man walking on the moon thing? y'know? you can.. you can see the strings people!
joey,no..nonono...i need a good lie to explain why i wasn't at the work thing today.
phoebe,"oo. honey, you stink at lying."
joey,wha? i do not!
phoebe,"oh really? let me ask you something. yesterday at the coffeehouse, i went to the bathroom, and when i came back, my muffin was gone. who took it?"
joey,"somebody opened the door...to the coffeehouse, and a, raccoon (emphasizes), came running in and went straight for your muffin i said ""hey! don't eat that! that's phoebe's!"" and he said...[pauses for a while...realizing how stupid it sounds] he said ""joey, you stink at lying"". what am i going to do?"
phoebe,"don't worry, don't worry. we'll come up with a good lie. i'll help you practice it."
joey,oh that'd be great. that'd be great. thank you.
phoebe,sure. what was the work thing?
phoebe,pick up grandma at the airport?
joey,"yes you are. i think it may be time for my sponge bath. sorry, i'm just so used to hitting on the extras. so, are you excited about your scene?"
phoebe,yeah! but i'm a little shaky and nervous.
joey,"oh, relax. don't be. you'll be fine, you'll be fine. they'll probably just make you stand in the back."
phoebe,"okay, now. what?"
phoebe,"i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. i'm just a little nervous."
phoebe,"okay, that helps."
joey,"hey, you know what? don't worry, pheebs! it usually takes me three takes too! (off the director's look) alright, eight."
chandler,"no, no. but let me show you what i can do. ""bagels and donuts. round food for every mood."""
chandler,really? that's great!
chandler,"it's funny. when you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid."""
chandler,"actually, we're trying, and i don't think monica's gonna wanna postpone it. we're supposed to have sex tonight. actually, she's probably at home naked right now. i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. i can just picture her on the bed right now."
rachel,"wait a minute! what do you mean, you're taking over my job?"
rachel,a vacation? my idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
ross,"come on. there are plenty of women out there, ok. just...just forget about her…ok? she’s off limits."
joey,"owww man…why you had to go and said that for? now that you told me i cant have her, makes me want her even more!"
ross,what are you a child?
joey,yesss!
ross,"look. joey, come on. now, for me. please, just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else."
joey,alright.
monica,take me home!
phoebe,hey mikey.
phoebe,what are you doing?
phoebe,to kill bob?
phoebe,": but no, mike, i don’t want to kill him. i thought we were just gonna capture him and, you know set him free in the countryside, where you can may be meet, you know, a friendly possum and a wise cracking owl."
phoebe,"ok, i will find bob. i will get him. (calling for bob) bob! bob robert!)"
phoebe,oh wait. i think i hear him.
chandler,no!
ross,at least tell me where you hid it.
rachel,can i ask you a question?
monica,yeah.
rachel,have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
monica,"let me think. oh, when i was younger i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese, and on our wedding night i ate his head."
rachel,"ok, well this is like that...in no way. i had a...i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey."
monica,"wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?"
rachel,"oh yeah! i mean, that was pretty intense."
monica,what do you think brought than on?
rachel,"i don't know! i mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday."
monica,a love scene? with who?
rachel,olivia.
monica,"olivia? i thought she was marrying connor! (pause) oh right, real life more important."
rachel,so do you think that my dream means anything?
monica,"i don't know. i mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for joey, maybe you have a thing for drake."
rachel,"ok, great!"
rachel,"oh, thank god i can't hear a word that you're saying!"
phoebe,(sticks her head out) i didn't say anything yet!
rachel,"(sticks her head out too) well, get back in there and talk!"
phoebe,(goes back in) i'm rachel. it's so annoying when i put emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
rachel,(comes out again) what!?
phoebe,"(comes out too) well, some things are just hard to say to your face."
rachel,"ok well, i heard that! which means that she heard it too!"
phoebe,ooh! we have a problem.
rachel,oh! what are we gonna do?
rachel,oh my god!
rachel,(yelling at the stranger) alright! enough out of you!
joey,hello?
ross,"joey! hey, i need to talk to charlie. is she there?"
rachel,"so you eh, you talked to joey?"
ross,"ah, yeah. we had a really good talk."
rachel,oh! that's great!
ross,yeah!
rachel,"oh, so everything's okay?"
ross,"oh, no, it's great. it's great. he is... he is an amazing guy."
rachel,"ah... well, obviously i think so too."
ross,"well, i'm so excited about this."
rachel,really? excited?
ross,are you kidding? i have had some very dirty dreams about this...
rachel,"excuse me! (and she walks back to joey, who is still looking very impressed about what ross said to him. rachel looks at him and hits him.) you didn't tell him, did you?"
joey,i couldn't. he was saying all these really nice things about me. i didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. i'm on a edge on chandler.
rachel,"oh god! alright, fine. you know what joey, forget it. when we go back to new york, i will tell him."
joey,"thank you. yeah, i appreciate that."
phoebe,"hi, mike's place."
phoebe,"ooh, that was fast."
monica,"i know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! no one here even knows you!"
chandler,"oh, come on!"
monica,"hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!"
chandler,why are you here?
chandler,"(to heaven) no no no... i mean, why? why is she here??"
chandler,what!?
monica,this was fun! but i've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! (leaves)
chandler,"i'd love to stay, but i have eh... (points at the cup) got a hot date... (starts to leave)"
chandler,(disgusted) i think it just fell off. (leaves)
phoebe,"(in a strange heavy accent) hello ""ja"", it's time for your massage, ja! put your face in the hole."
rachel,"wow, a swedish massage from a real swedish person. (puts her head in the hole and phoebe enters)"
phoebe,"okay, then i'm swedish..."
monica,"so, what's your name?"
phoebe,it's a normal swedish name... ikea...
rachel,oh... what an interesting name.
phoebe,ja!
monica,"un, no you didn't! you must be mistaken!"
chandler,"honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!"
monica,"chandler, sense the tone!!"
rachel,"well, well, well, look what mommy found!!"
monica,"ok, fine!! i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler."
phoebe,uh! the psychic also said that i would be betrayed.
ross,"i can't believe this, i thought we were all in this together!"
monica,"hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!"
ross,3 minutes ago!!! i don't know why that's important ...
joey,"i was with you the whole time we were in connecticut, when did you even get those?"
monica,when you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
joey,(to ross) i'll show you how.
rachel,"ok, well monica, suppose one of your ""special"" tickets win? how are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?"
monica,"please ... if i win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and i couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!"
monica,no!
chandler,did somebody sign your bra?
monica,so i got it when i was 13...
phoebe,"hey ross! so listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of nobel prizes scare you off? what is that, come on, a piece of paper?"
ross,"it's actually a 1,000,000$ prize."
phoebe,"go charlie! but my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average joe phd."
ross,"yeah, maybe. i do have my whole career in front of me. i mean, i can still win a nobel prize. although the last two papers i've written were widely discredited."
phoebe,"you're so much more than just brains! you're sweet, and kind, and funny..."
ross,and sexy.
phoebe,ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
ross,"yeah, you're right, thanks pheebs, i'm gonna go find her."
phoebe,"good for you! and hey, i thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the devonian era was top notch!"
ross,stop going through my stuff (walks away)!
rachel,(to monica) hey!
chandler,that's why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross!
joey,"come on, i'll show you guys where to check in (joey, chandler and david leave)"
monica,"(to chandler) oh, honey, can you make sure we get a king size bed!"
phoebe,"(shouts after david) oh! david, get one for us too! oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! and with mirrors on the ceiling!"
monica,(shouts to chandler) and make sure our room isn't next to theirs (points to phoebe).
rachel,"ooh! you guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. that's all, i just wish i could (looks at joey who is at the check in desk) share that with a guy."
phoebe,not joey.
rachel,"not joey, no, i was just lusting after chandler."
monica,"yeah, right!"
chandler,"tonight?! (looks at the ring) isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) oh, there it is!"
chandler,(slaps him on the shoulder) nice! (goes to monica)
chandler,"monica, can i talk to you for a sec? (pulls her away from phoebe and rachel)"
monica,ok!
chandler,david is going to propose to phoebe tonight!
monica,see what happens when you give people advice? i hope you told him not to?
phoebe,oh!
phoebe,no! i definitely don't wanna get married. no i just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. whew! coz you know when we move in...and you start changing your mind..there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
phoebe,yeah i get that.
rachel,hi!
monica,so you gave in and decided to call someone?
rachel,yeah...i don't know who i was kidding. i can barely use chopsticks.
rachel,oh thank you so much. oh oh wait! you forgot your erm...your game.
chandler,hey rach! there she is...my perfectly proportioned wife.
rachel,don't look at me i never get his jokes.
monica,thank you?
chandler,oh no..don't thank me. thank you. you know there's not one thing i would change about you? not one single thing! and definitely not...two...single things.
monica,ok...you're being wierd. do you want sex or did you do something bad?
chandler,no no! i just love the way you look... i am warm...for your form.
monica,ok..you know the old classics you know..you look nice? they're still ok.
rachel,"joey, emma's right here! you promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore."
joey,"no, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new hugsy!"
rachel,"oh that's so great, now emma has two hugsy's."
joey,"no, no, emma has one hugsy, the new hugsy, huh? the other hugsy, i don't know, i guess i'll just take it back."
rachel,"oh you know what? when i was a little girl i had a little pink pony named cotton. oh i loved her so much, i took her everywhere, i would braid her tail..."
joey,make the transfer! (she does so)
rachel,should i be concerned that a button fell off the old hugsy and i can't find it?
joey,"oh, no don't worry about that, i swallowed that years ago."
rachel,"oh, i don't think she likes the new hugsy."
joey,but he's the same.
rachel,"yeah, i think she wants the old one back."
joey,but he's the same.
rachel,"joey, come on!"
joey,he's the same!
joey,(to the new hugsy) you're not the same!
phoebe,"who cares, it got you here."
phoebe,wow. where is your luggage? (david thinks for a while)
phoebe,"a-allright, well... i'll call the cab company."
phoebe,"thank you! god, no! you should see me when... oh actually, no, i look pretty good."
phoebe,no...
phoebe,i'm... i'm just... i'm the worst person ever. how can i not tell david that i'm seeing mike?
monica,maybe he didn't give you a chance.
phoebe,he said: are you seeing someone? and i said no...
monica,"oh, well... that had been your window."
phoebe,"yeah! i mean, i don't know. i was just , i was looking, i was looking in his eyes and i was just thinking: oh my god! it's david. david's here. he's just, he's so irresistible."
monica,really? the scientist guy?
phoebe,really? chandler?
monica,continue...
phoebe,"oh.okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then i told him that i would see him tomorrow night."
monica,phoebe!
joey,why are you dressed like that?
monica,"[nervous giggle] because i, erm, well, chandler’s gonna be home in a couple of days, so i thought that i would just, er, practice the art of seduction."
joey,i thought i heard a man’s voice before?
monica,"i was just doing chandler’s side of the conversation, y’know like “hi”, “how do i look” [in chandler’s voice] “really sexy”, “could i be any more turned on?”"
joey,"woah, woah, woah. why are there two glasses of wine out?"
monica,"because, one of them is for you! [monica goes to get a glass. chandler looks at joey through the peep-hole and chandler ducks. monica comes back to the door with the two glasses of red wine. gives one to joey. ‘clinks’ the glasses together] okay, bye, bye!"
chandler,"you know, it’s funny. i’ve been practising the art of seduction as well! hya! [does a wiggle]"
monica,you might wanna keep practising.
chandler,yeah. [chandler’s phone goes off] it’s joey.
monica,what?
chandler,"hey, joe!"
joey,"dude, come home!"
chandler,what? why?
ross,you look great.
monica,hey joey
joey,"hey, this girl won't turn around and i can't tell whether she's hot or not, what do you think?"
monica,joey i am not going to objectify woman with you (looks at the woman) but if her face is as nice as her ass woah mamma.
joey,"alright thanks, oh hey have you talked to chandler?"
monica,yeah he has to stay in tulsa this weekend
joey,how come?
monica,"he has to work, there's some rush on the big (pause, thinks) ah damn it one of these days i'm really gonna have to start listening when he talks about his job."
joey,oh why don't you fly out there and surprise him.
monica,maybe i will go (thinks) yea will have a second honeymoon at the tulsa romana.
joey,oh and you know what you should bring the black see-through teddy with the attached garters. (nods)
monica,how do you know i have one of those?
joey,didn't till just now.
joey,hot not hot (she turns around) hot!
joey,i said i think you're hot and now i'm embarrassed.
chandler,"(getting in) okay, something to cover the smell ... oven cleaner! (sprays himself, reads label) unscented!"
monica,(naughty in doorway) welcome home. i've missed you. join me in the bedroom?
chandler,"no thanks, i'm good."
monica,"(comes over) o-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?"
chandler,"(shrinks back) right. you know what? actually i just get off the plane, so i'm feeling kinda gross. maybe i should just take a shower."
monica,you don't need a shower.
chandler,"(still backs away) alright, the truth is, i soiled myself during some turbulences."
monica,what do i smell? (sniffs him) i smell smoke. huh--did you smoke?
chandler,"yes, but i just had one. two. two tiny cigarettes. okay, five. a pack. two pack...a...a carton. three big fat cartons in two days. (how many cigs are there in one pack and how many packs in one carton in the us?) but it's over, i made a decision, i'm not gonna smoke anymore."
monica,(gets a pack out of his jacket)
chandler,"but, those are for you."
ross,"alright, we'll just, uh, see when you get here. bye. (hangs up) huh, that was my mom, she's stuck in terrible traffic."
rachel,"okay, well that's now the third sign that i should not leave emma."
chandler,"maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing"
ross,"no no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar."
chandler,did she go out with him?
ross,"no. when he called, i...i threw the message away."
chandler,ah! the high road...
ross,you know what? enough! enough talking! i have to get moving! hey check out those two blondes over there!
chandler,are you trying to get everybody divorced?
ross,"you don't have to do anything. it will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? you...you break the"
chandler,i thought i had to make the jokes!
ross,don't you have to be at work?
chandler,"oh come on! hello! hi! my name is chandler, here's my friend ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it."
ross,"hum...so...hum...oh hey i noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in europe? here’s a question: ""would you..."
chandler,we still got it!
rachel,who is it?
rachel,"chandler, that's not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? and you've just gotten her one great present? i mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. why would you do that to her chandler? why? why?"
chandler,"if i help, we can find 'em faster!"
rachel,that's right!
phoebe,"ooh ooh, we have a live one!"
rachel,"oh, it's a macy's bag!"
rachel,oh.
phoebe,"ooh, who's it for?"
rachel,"(reading from a tag that's attached to the shoe) ""dear losers, do you really think i'd hide presents under the couch? p.s.: chandler, i knew they'd break you."""
joey,"rach, these are for you."
rachel,wiper blades. i don't even have a car.
joey,"no, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."
chandler,"ok, pheebs, your turn."
phoebe,"ahh, toilet seat covers! is that what you were doing while i was getting gas?"
joey,uh-huh.
phoebe,you guuuyys.
joey,"and for ross, mr. sweet-tooth."
ross,you got me a cola drink?
joey,ohhh man! [covers his eyes and bends down]
rachel,oh she's precious...
rachel,"amy...yes i do, i really do. [reaches out toward ross and he grabs her hand]"
ross,sure! we don't live there but...
rachel,"yeah, no ross has a phd."
rachel,god! she is...unbelievable!
ross,i know! i mean a phd is just as good as an md.
rachel,"yeah, oh sure ross yeah! if i have a heart attack at a restaurant, i want you there with your fossil brush!"
rachel,what? what? what happened?
ross,don't say that!
rachel,oh amy...don't cry. erm. ross? could i talk to you in private?
ross,sure you wanna go upstairs? or...
rachel,"erm look. i was thinking, if it's ok with monica, i would like to invite amy, to thanksgiving."
rachel,"alright! don't get too comfortable there, because i'm back in two weeks! and i want everything back to the way it was. i can't say that i care too much for the way you've rearranged my office."
rachel,excuse me?
ross,rach we have a code brown situation.
rachel,"can you please, please take care of it for me?"
ross,"alright, but you have to do one sometime."
rachel,let me just get this straight! so i go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
rachel,that's right. you're very cheeky for a temp.
rachel,"oh yeah, what department was that? the jerk department?"
rachel,did they mention that i'm rubber and you're glue?
rachel,"oh, hi mr. zelner."
rachel,"that's great. so now, super gavin, when i come back where are you planning on flying off to?"
rachel,"(to herself) oh, wow. super ass-kissing power."
rachel,today.
rachel,"no, i said today! see, for a superhero, not so much with the listening."
phoebe,oh my god…bob had babies…bob is a mom.
phoebe,oh i don’t know. i kinda like bob for a girl.
phoebe,"oh my god, you killed bob?"
phoebe,(she calls out loudly)suzie? (she got up to see what it is.)
ross,whaaat’sss uupppp?
chandler,"(standing up) seriously dude, three years ago."
ross,"listen, can you do me a favour? i’m gonna be out today. can you just keep an eye on joey? make sure nothing happens between him and molly?"
chandler,you don’t trust him?
ross,"what? no. some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, err… the hot nanny."
chandler,is this really your long term plan for me to run interference? because i can get a job any day now. (he sit down and put his legs on the table.)
ross,"you do appear right on the *** something . oh come one. i’m sure he will lose interest in a week or two. but for now, can you please just do this for me?"
chandler,"alright, fine. but don’t blame me if it doesn’t work cause you know as well as i do, once joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he’s going to have sex with it."
ross,"well, well i mean we got to do something, ok? nanny's like her doesn’t grow on trees."
chandler,picturing that tree?
ross,oh yeah.
chandler,where are you going joe?
rachel,ah! well it was joey reading drake's lines in the dream...
monica,"of course it was! trust me, when it comes to psychology i know what i'm talking about. i took two psych classes in college."
rachel,you took the same class twice.
monica,it was hard!
phoebe,hey!
phoebe,"here, monica, look what i got to wear when i play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) right? i mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man."
monica,"oh...phoebe? maybe i wasn't clear before. i really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place."
phoebe,"right, yeah, ok, i'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault."
monica,"phoebe, it's not what you wear. it's sort of your songs... i just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore."
phoebe,"oh, ok. fine, i'll just, i'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot)."
rachel,"hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work..."
phoebe,my songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
rachel,"ok, we're still on that."
joey,no. no... eh... she went shopping with rachel. why? what's up?
ross,i'm meeting with professor sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
joey,oh! how's it going?
ross,"it could be better! he, uhm... he fell asleep!"
joey,what!? but i already bought my ticket to bermuda!
ross,barbados.
joey,"fine, i'll rent a car and drive...! ross, you have to get that job!"
ross,what am i supposed to do? he's out cold! in fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named fran to spank him harder.
joey,"well, just wake him up!"
ross,"i can't! if he realizes that i'm the one that put him to sleep, i won't get the job!"
joey,"uh! that's a tough one. oh! wait a minute, this happened to me before! yeah, i was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... yeah i mean hey, shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?"
monica,hey guys! dinner's ready!
chandler,"so what do you think? i want that guys genes for my kid! those eyes, those cheeckbones!"
monica,"ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!"
chandler,you don't like him.
monica,i think he is fine! it's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
phoebe,"yeah, you can't do that! oh, come on mike, strap on a pair.why don't you just tell her that we got back together. you know, women appreciate honesty. we also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. just f.y.i."
phoebe,her name is precious? is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
phoebe,"okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)"
phoebe,(stunned) i... i'm phoebe.
phoebe,"enchanté (she holds out her hand, and they shake hands)"
monica,"oh, i can't wait for everyone at work to see these... (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) ow!"
chandler,"you go back to work tomorrow night, right?"
monica,yeah!
chandler,"so if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?"
monica,"well, if i had them taken out, then i wouldn't be able to do this. (she pushes chandler on the couch and brushes her hair and shells against chandler's chest) you like that, right? (again, she brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)"
chandler,what are you singing?
monica,"it's ""bolero"" from ""10""."
chandler,"it's ""ride of the valkyries"" from ""apocalypse now""... see, here's the thing: the corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. and now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... i hate them!"
monica,you what? you said you liked them.
chandler,did i? let's refresh. i believe what i said was that i could see your scalp.
rachel,you know i... (lifts her head and tries to look in phoebe's direction)
phoebe,(pushes her head back down) time for your scalp massage!
rachel,(sees phoebe's slippers through the hole) wow... i really love your... (startled as she realizes those are phoebe's slippers)
phoebe,is something wrong?
rachel,"no, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... ikea... (pause) yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of sweden?"
phoebe,(thinks for a few moments) uhm... stockholm.
rachel,damn! i wish i knew if that was right!
joey,(gesturing at an imaginary painting) note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
ross,"now, do you have any idea what you just said?"
joey,"(shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) no, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!"
ross,"ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, monet is not spelt m-o-n-a-y. i just... i wrote that out phonetically for you."
joey,phonetically? (looks confused)
ross,"yeah, yeah that means... you know? we just... we don't have time for this."
joey,ok.
ross,"ok, but you know what? i gotta say, i'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!"
rachel,"chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?"
chandler,"(to mon) she's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ..."
monica,ahhh! (shocked)
chandler,"let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, it doesn't look like i'm gonna get this job so i can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from rachel)"
monica,there's the man i married!!
rachel,"all right, believe me.if you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!"
monica,"fine! don't be my friends! i'll buy new friends! yeah, and then i'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!"
rachel,"(surprised) oh! alright, you know what? that's it! i want my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!"
joey,"yeah, i want my tickets too (takes the bowl from rachel)! and i'm buying the knicks! and steffi graff, ah ah!"
ross,"than i want mine, too (takes the bowl from joey)! and if i win i'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond."
phoebe,"oh, you guys! we've got to keep all the tickets together (takes the bowl from ross and puts it on the table)"
monica,"no, no! we should divide them up (picks up the bowl) and i should get extra because we used my card to buy them!"
joey,"hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! this all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from monica)"
chandler,"oh, yeah! thanks for inventing the lottery!"
rachel,"ok, that's it! just give'em to me! i'll split them up! (she tries to snatch the bowl from joey's hands but she can't, so she pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)"
joey,(in pain) oh!
monica,hey!
rachel,"i just wanted to let you know i've changed my mind: i'm gonna do it, i'm gonna kiss joey."
monica,"no, you can't! friends hooking up is a bad idea."
rachel,"please, what about you and chandler?"
monica,that's different! i was drunk and stupid!
rachel,well hello (points to herself)!
monica,what about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? why don't you just kiss one of them?
rachel,"i could, i could but i don't want to! i want to kiss joey!"
monica,alright (shrugs). i think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
rachel,(pause) i'm gonna do it.
monica,and i can't stop you.
rachel,no.
ross,"(to rachel) hey rach, have you seen charlie anywhere?"
ross,i'm smarter than him!
phoebe,"hey, thank you so much for these tickets, chandler."
chandler,"oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and i wanted to share it with you."
chandler,that would be advice!!
monica,ok fine. i'll handle this. (goes to phoebe who's talking to rachel) phoebe?
phoebe,yeah?
monica,(looking very serious) i need to talk to you.
phoebe,"are you leaving ""the supremes""? (monica and phoebe go to one side)"
monica,"ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. look, david is going to propose to you tonight."
phoebe,wow? really? that's fantastic!
monica,what are you serious? you wanna marry him? wha... what about mike?
phoebe,"oh, ok, you want me to marry mike? alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. i can just see it: ""mike, do you take phoebe..."" (gestures with her hand as if someone is covering her mouth and tries to shout ""no! no!"") you know, it's every girl's dream!"
monica,do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
phoebe,"sure! look, ok, bottom line: i love mike... david! david. i love david. don't look at me that way, roseanne rosannadanna!"
ross,"by using ct scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century."
ross,"oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because i won't be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. (someone knocks on the door, ross goes to open and it's joey, rachel and chandler)."
joey,hey guys!
ross,the chocolates aren't here yet.
chandler,"well yes yes...you look nice can mean that your face looks nice. i want to compliment your body. i mean..i wouldn't change it..at all. and more specifically, i wouldn't want anything to get any bigger."
monica,o..k...
chandler,i mean..you wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? don't answer that.
rachel,just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
monica,i know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
rachel,i don't know! i mean...what brought that on?
monica,oh my god. we're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
rachel,no...you really think that's what it is?
monica,"you heard him! ""no bigger!"" ""you're perfect!"" ""just don't get any bigger!"" oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. you know what? i'm going to have to talk to chandler."
rachel,yeah! if you don't i will! of course your body's gonna change. your breasts are gonna get bigger..your ass is gonna get bigger...you're gonna lose bladder control. (she starts sobbing) god! it's just such a magical time!
phoebe,hi
ross,hey!
phoebe,"listen, i wanted to ask you something about marriage."
ross,oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? i mean i can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
phoebe,no...i really wanted to know how you feel about it.
ross,why?
monica,haha!
phoebe,"you know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after i've buzzed you into the building."
monica,"so phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door."
phoebe,those are my shoes.
monica,"oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping."
phoebe,"monica, i really appreciate you checking in on me, but i'm actually feeling a lot better. yeah, i just kinda want to be alone right now."
monica,who's that? (goes to open door)
phoebe,i ordered chinese food.
phoebe,what are the chances? 1 billion chinese people and they send mike!?
monica,(to mike) what are you doing here?
monica,phoebe!
phoebe,"i'm sorry, i broke down... i wanted to see him."
monica,damnit phoebe! how did you even call him?
phoebe,there is a speakerphone on the base unit...
monica,base unit! think monica! think!
monica,(to mike) this doesn't concern you!!
phoebe,"i know! (points at herself) evil! and... and... and... i like mike so much, you know. it's just going really well. oh my god!"
monica,"wow, isn't it ironic that david would show up on the same day that you and mike exchange keys?"
phoebe,"(sarcastically) uhuh... yeah...!, you know. and given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy i am."
monica,what are you gonna do?
phoebe,"i mean i guess, i just have to... tell david that nothing can happen between us. unless i don't... you know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong..."
monica,you have to tell david!
phoebe,"okay, i knew i should have had this conversation with joey."
chandler,"(angry) funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) i'm funny, right...? what do you know, you're a door... you just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) save it for inside! (he enters)"
monica,heeeeeey!
chandler,hey!
phoebe,hey!
chandler,"so... oklahoma is a crazy place. you know, they call it the sooner state. frankly i'd sooner be in any other state. (monica looks at phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) and what's with oklahoma having a pan handle? can all states have stuff like that? hey yeah, i'm from the waistband, wyoming. but when i was seven, we headed over to the crotch."
monica,(doesn't believe what she's hearing) was your cabin pressurised?
joey,come home!
chandler,"look, i can’t. what’s going on?"
joey,"i don’t know how to tell you this, but i think that monica’s cheating on ya! i told you that you shouldn’t have married someone much hotter than you! chandler looks at monica. they nod then put their ears back to the phone. joey walks out of his apartment and up to monica’s door] right, look. if you can’t come home and deal with this, then i'm gonna…"
chandler,[loudly] no!
joey,i just heard him!
chandler,[quiet] can you hear him now?
joey,"no. right, i’m going in!"
chandler,[loudly] no! wait!
joey,i heard him again!
chandler,right. just stay there. i'm coming home.
joey,great. i’ll see you when you get here. i’m gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.
chandler,is that really necessary?
joey,"absolutely. you’d do it for me! not that you’d ever have to, ‘cos i know how to keep my women completely satisfied."
ross,shouldn’t the pizza be here by now? they said 30 minutes or less. how long has it been?
ross,i do. i do. although it is actually a lager.
joey,"that would've been better, i'll try that hi i'm joey."
joey,look i don't usually ask out women that i meet in coffeehouses
joey,(turns round) gesundheit
joey,"really, great, did i actually ask you?"
joey,"(turns round again) seriously gunther you should see someone about that cold, if it gets much worse you could die! (gunther looks scared)"
ross,so how'd the date go?
phoebe,well it was awful every time i thought about what you said i started crying.
ross,so he hasn't called?
phoebe,would you call this girl? (puts on a crying act) thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing
ross,now i feel terrible this is all my fault.
phoebe,"well you not what you should feel terrible about, this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?"
ross,we are a rare breed.
joey,yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that last piece of cake at the restaurant.
joey,do you have any cake?
joey,(bends down to see and the cactus pricks him in the ass) awch! that's why.
ross,"oh, what were the other two?"
rachel,"well, let's see. the first one is: i don't want to. and, you know, i'm not going."
ross,"i know, it's the first time, we're leaving the baby and ... hey, i know how hard it is for you, but ... but emma is gonna be fine. my mom is gonna be with her. she's great with kids."
rachel,she is?
ross,ya.
rachel,what about (?) monica.
ross,"hey, you only heard monica's side of that. that little fatso was a terror."
rachel,ish. i just don't think i can bear it.
ross,"rachel, i know that you can. and you should."
rachel,uch.
ross,"really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you, why don't you go ahead to the restaurant and i will wait for my mom and then i'll meet you there."
rachel,oh-a.
ross,"no, no, really. you should go. just go! go! go out! really, the world is your oyster. kick up the heels. paint the town red. (slang right?)"
rachel,you need to learn some new slang.
ross,"i'm serious. c'mon, you should go. here. (shoves her outside, while she tries to stay) no, uh-uh, just go."
rachel,what ... oh! (points inside)
rachel,why?
rachel,"oh! right! yeah! hold on, i'll be just clean up in here a little bit! hello gavin"
rachel,"i a not gonna lie to you, i'm pretty sick"
rachel,oh no no no
rachel,so did i
rachel,it's just a cold
rachel,what? what's the matter?
rachel,oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. he thought it would be funny.
rachel,"oh you're not. you're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about ross really, really."
rachel,i lied! and i'm not sick! just stay behind the curtain!
rachel,oh! molly! you're not ross.
rachel,"right, right, yes!"
rachel,what?
rachel,no! that's ok! that's ok! that's ok! no no no no! this is my business associate gavin. he's just being silly.
chandler,"and, a lemon lime."
ross,"well this, this is too much, i feel like i should get you another sweater."
chandler,and last but not least.
joey,they're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
ross,"ooh, hey ben, what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?"
ross,yeah!
monica,come on ben.
ross,years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees...
chandler,"(entering in a santa costume) ho, ho, ho! merry christmas!"
chandler,hey! (grunts as ben hits him at full speed.)
ross,"what are you doing here, santa?"
chandler,"well, i'm here to see my old buddy ben. what are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?"
ross,"i'm the holiday armadillo, your part-jewish friend. you sent me here to give ben some presents. remember?"
chandler,what?
monica,"okay ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and santa, the armadillo and i have a little talk in the kitchen? there's a sentence i'd never thought i'd say."
ross,(to chandler) what are you doing?
ross,you know i think that's a great idea. it'll be like the pilgrims being in the indian's syphillis.
rachel,"look, i know she's a little tough to take...but she has no where else to go. and she's my sister. alright? and she's emma's aunt? and i'd like them to bond..."
ross,ok...fine. but i don't want them bonding too much. i don't want her telling emma she needs a nose job.
rachel,"well! ross, you know what? she may need one we're just going to have to make our peace with that."
rachel,hi!!
rachel,"hey you guys! this is my sister amy...this is chandler, joey, phoebe and you know mon!"
joey,yeah!
monica,hi. [they exchange pecks on the cheek]
joey,phoebs! i still need some help here.
phoebe,"oh! right ok. erm...ok..so it's not just the lie you tell, but it's the way you tell it for example, if you look down on the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying."
joey,"oh...(nodding)i don't know why this is so hard for me...y'know what i mean? lying is basically just acting, and i am a terrific actor!(smirks)"
phoebe,you are a (looks down suddenly) terrific actor!
rachel,oh we just put her down for a nap.
ross,thank you amy!
ross,emma.
joey,hey.
phoebe,"hey. so, what did he say?"
joey,"well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so i'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word ""puppy."" okay, so he said: ""if your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, i'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass."""
phoebe,"i'm sorry, i can't do this. i'm not an actor."
joey,"that's right, you're not. you're a nurse. you're nurse with tray."
phoebe,joey.
joey,"no, no. nurse with tray doesn't know joey, she doesn't have time for friends. she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!"
phoebe,who dies?
joey,(points to man on operating table) man with eye patch! you get in there and you do your job.
phoebe,"yes, doctor."
joey,okay.
phoebe,"hang in there, man with eye patch, your tray is coming!"
phoebe,"(does the scene) yes, i did it!!! i nailed it!!! yay! what's next?"
phoebe,"okay, from the top, people!"
joey,for a walk.
chandler,"oh, you mind if i join you?"
joey,"actually, er, i would rather to be alone. you know i really need to…organize my thoughts."
chandler,your thoughts? plural?
joey,"alright, fine. i only have one thought. it’s about the hot nanny. i've got to see her."
chandler,i’m afraid i can’t let you do that joe.
joey,"now you’re telling me i can’t see her? you guys are killing me. she’s a forbidden fruit. it’s like, like, she’s the princess and i’m the stable boy (chandler looked irritated). why are you doing this, huh? did ross tell you not to let me to go over there?"
chandler,"yes, as a matter of fact, he did. so i can’t let you go."
joey,huh? interesting. now there are obstacles. hot nanny and me against the world. this is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
chandler,great novels?
joey,fine. mediocre porn!
rachel,rachel greene’s office. give me the phone.
rachel,"hello, this is rachel greene. how can i help you? uh- huh. ok then. i’ll pass you back to your son. (she hands back the phone)"
rachel,hmm. excuse me gavin. i have a question i need to ask you.
rachel,"if you like looking at butt so much, why don’t you just go look at a mirror?"
monica,i didn't say your songs were not good enough.
phoebe,then what's wrong with them? would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
monica,tiny portions?
phoebe,"yeah well, ""excuse me, i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) i can't see it, i can't see it""!"
monica,"phoebe, it's not about quantity."
phoebe,well...it's not about quality.
monica,"oh really, you want to talk about quality? have you heard of a key? it's what some people sing in."
phoebe,"well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. yeah, there are other ingredients monica."
monica,"ok, so that's what we're doing. you know, when i'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, i'm wearing ear plugs."
phoebe,"ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?"
monica,"you know what? i take back what i said before. you keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy."
phoebe,"what are people having, the garlic martini?"
chandler,"oh we did, and you still have all your lamps."
chandler,"oh, i didn't factor in the room tax."
chandler,alright! just follow my lead!
chandler,"oh! thanks, i'm crazy about our place. hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?"
chandler,(very seriously) that's really not the kind of thing we are looking for zack.
monica,"oh, friends first, drunk in london, you know the story. i've got a better question for you: do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?"
monica,"eh... heart disease, alzheimers, gout?"
monica,we're just making conversation. (chandler makes an agreeing-sound)
chandler,"you know what's not funny? male pattern baldness (monica stretches her neck to look behind zack's head and then gives chandler an ""ok"" sign)"
chandler,i noticed you were enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. did you have braces as a child?
monica,yess!! (m & c high-five and zack looks confused again)
chandler,(proceeding with his dinner) we're teeth people zack!
rachel,alright! let's just do it. let's just go over there and see if she heard.
phoebe,good plan.
rachel,ok. (phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. rachel sees and follows her) wha...? where? where are you going?
monica,"fine, so you don't like them. everybody else does."
chandler,"again, let's journey back... as i recall what rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. and joey... well, joey didn't realise that there was anything different."
monica,"you know what? i don't care. i like it like this, and i'm gonna keep it. you're just jealous because your hair can't do this... (and she shakes her head more violently) ouch!"
chandler,hit yourself in the tooth?
monica,and the eye!
ross,"(gasps) hi... there she is. hi emma. oh my god, i missed you. (kisses her) oh emma, i missed you so much. hey... did you have a good time with grandma green? huh? did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? (to rachel)"
rachel,"that was one time, ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams."
ross,"ooh hey, emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? okay? i want you to wait right here. come here sweetie."
rachel,"aaah... ross, actually there's something that i really need to talk to you about."
ross,"(unpacking his bag) okay, shoot!"
rachel,"okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal."
ross,(gasps) oh no!
rachel,what? what is it?
ross,"oh, major shampoo explosion!"
rachel,"uh, look ross, this really isn't easy."
ross,"oh, it's all over everything. why? why me? (looks up)"
rachel,because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
joey,"ah! i'm an actor! i can memorize anything! last week on ""days"" i had to say ""frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy""."
ross,wow. what does that mean?
joey,"no idea! but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear""."
ross,ok! so let's move on to the renaissance?
joey,"ok, caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. touch it, it's really bumpy! (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting)."
ross,"nah ah! nah ah! (stops him form doing so) no no no! no ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings."
joey,come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)
ross,no! (slaps his hand)
chandler,(to the nurse at the nurses' station) my specimen is in the room and i just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while i was in there. really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees janice is still there) janice! you're not... gone?
chandler,yeah! yeah... the hard part is over!
chandler,i haven't... i haven't even thought about the results yet... i just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
chandler,"(slightly panicky) yeah, but what if it's not? what if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?"
chandler,"(smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. i can't believe i didn't even think of that. i guess i was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'..."
chandler,"(stares at her intently, then yells) it was a ""wendy's!! """
phoebe,(she takes the bowl from rachel's hands and she starts running around the room and yelling) ooooohhhhh!
ross,"(trying to stop her) hey, hey!!"
phoebe,"(keeping on running and yelling) ooooohhhhh! (she stops) fine, i can't take it anymore! i'm putting an end to this! (she goes out to the balcony)"
rachel,"oh, if she jumps, i get her tickets."
joey,"no, no! (they all go towards the balcony but they get jammed in the window)"
phoebe,"if we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! so, say goodbye to your tickets! (she holds out the bowl, and makes as to drop the tickets on the street)."
phoebe,don't come any closer!
chandler,"can i come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished..."
phoebe,"no, what's more important, your friends or money?"
monica,money! (they all look at her) friends...
phoebe,"hey monica, what about your extra tickets?"
monica,they're all in there! even these five that i hid in my bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to phoebe)...
ross,monica!
phoebe,"ok, good! (pause) you guys were so scared! there was no way i was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring phoebe who drops the bowl on the street) oh god, no! (pause) i think i broke your bowl."
ross,"go, go, go!!"
phoebe,"what a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. and the wind sure made it fun."
monica,"oh, you're so wonderful."
chandler,"can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away)."
joey,damnit!
chandler,"oh, is it on the computer, cuz i'd love to give it a read...?"
ross,"if you want to check your email, just ask! (chandler tries to look offended)"
chandler,(offended) what? (pause) may i?
rachel,"(looking out the window) what's with the rain, geller? i mean, when i signed up for dino week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season."
rachel,it's not the time charlie.
chandler,"(at the laptop) oh, no, no, no dear god, no!"
joey,"oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? (chandler looks annoyed at him and joey leans in to him) oh! secret teapot?"
chandler,"your computer, i don't know wha... everything's gone!"
ross,wha... what do you mean? (goes to the laptop)
chandler,it must be a virus. i think it erased your hard drive.
ross,"what, oh my god. what did you do?"
chandler,someone i don't know sent me an e-mail and i opened it.
phoebe,mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
ross,never?
phoebe,never.
ross,wow...are you still going to move in with him?
phoebe,"i want to...but i just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. you know...that i won't, i won't be missing out on anything. that marriage stinks!"
ross,yeah...marriage...stinks! i mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? get them married.
phoebe,that's not how you really feel is it?
ross,"no, i'm sorry. look i don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but i can't help it. i love marriage."
phoebe,seriously? you divorc-o?
ross,"if you have to call me name, i prefer ross the divorcer. it's just cooler. look...i know my marriage isn't exactly work out. but i love to be that committed to another person. and caroline and i had some good times before she became a lesbian! and once afterward. i'm sorry."
phoebe,it's ok that's how you feel.
ross,but come on! i mean living together will be great! i mean you guys have so much fun...and you love mike.
phoebe,i do love mike.
ross,yeah see? and you are so excited about moving in together before... and you know what? you should be. it's a big deal!
phoebe,yeah i guess you're right. yeah thanks. this helped. thanks.
ross,"the divorcer, to the rescue!"
phoebe,it's not cooler.
ross,yeah i just hurt it.
monica,"look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder."
phoebe,not if nothing happens. why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
monica,"sure! if you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe i'll join ya. you know, i'm your friend (to phoebe) and mike's friend (mike is sceptical)."
phoebe,sit down.
monica,oh wow wow wow!! make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them)
monica,i've been pretty good!
phoebe,"thanks, you look good too."
monica,oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. keep it clean!
phoebe,so how's the piano playing going?
phoebe,i've missed you too.
monica,"you know, on the way over here, i saw this drunk guy throw up. and then a pigeon ate it!"
chandler,"hey, ross, i just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?"
ross,"uhu uhu, check this out. (chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)"
chandler,"(laughs, but then moves to phoebe) and don't get me started on the way that people from tulsa talk."
phoebe,okay. (and she walks away)
chandler,"what's with the word y'all? you know, just... two words just... pushed together... are we all allowed to do that, because if so, i say why stop there? you know, your new poodle could be your noodle. and fried chicken? could be fricken.waiter, waiter excuse me, i'll have the fricken? (monica laughs) see, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?"
monica,"no, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. i told you about that funny guy, geoffrey, right?"
chandler,"yeah, he came up..."
monica,"well, he did this bit... you probably had to be there, but it was liza minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (phoebe bursts out in a laugh)"
chandler,(to phoebe) were you there?
phoebe,"no, but it sounds like it was fricken funny..."
rachel,"sandy, that's exactly what it is..."
ross,are you gay? (rachel turns to ross in an embarrassed way)
rachel,ross!
rachel,oh!
rachel,"oh, that's pretty."
ross,(skeptic) so you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
ross,"(on a yeah, right tone) okay."
ross,"yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. (in the other room emma starts to cry.)"
ross,i don’t know. we can look it up.
phoebe,"oh, god. do you remember the girls’ nights that we used to have? sitting around, talking about you and ross?"
rachel,"oh, god. it seems like forever ago."
phoebe,i know.
phoebe,so what’s going on with you and ross?
rachel,"well, um, i don’t know. i mean, for a long time, nothing. you know, actually, right before you picked me up, ross and i had a little thing."
phoebe,woah! oh my god! i love things! what happened?
rachel,"well, um, first he told me that he liked how i looked, and then, erm, we had a little, erm, eye contact."
phoebe,eye contact?
rachel,uh huh.
phoebe,i hope you were using protection.
phoebe,"should we send them something back? yes, let’s do! let’s send them mashed potatoes!!"
rachel,"no, wait, don’t do that! it’s gonna make them think that they can come over here!"
phoebe,"so, what if they do?"
rachel,we’re not here to meet guys. you have a boyfriend. i have a…baby and a ross.
phoebe,"yeah, but, um, nothing has to happen. just having fun. you know, not everything has to go as far as ‘eye contact’."
monica,"chandler, you have to tell joey that you are not in tulsa."
ross,"(he knocks at the door, mike opens it) hey mike sorry to just drop by like this, can i come in?"
ross,"i'm ross, phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse."
ross,"yeah i really, really need to talk to you about something."
ross,(laughs) no
ross,damn super cuts!
ross,"oh no yeah, no phoebe is great, but umm i'm an idiot look right before you guys went out i accidentally got her all upset."
ross,"yes, yeah i said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please don't blow her off."
ross,well then i didn't need to bother you or the four other mike hanagens i bothered.
ross,of course she has… if she'd never had a serious relationship i'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
ross,"yes, yes i did… and i will also say what i'm about to say vis-à-vis the following phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her… super-serious relationship with… vicrum."
ross,what that's a real name!
chandler,"(enters singing) oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plane, stop it! why couldn't they have sent me to texas? 7 o clock maybe i'll hit the gym (sits down) who am i kidding pay-per-view porn."
ross,"no! no, you know what? (closes the door) you [can't get in there] (?), the baby's fine, now squam (?). yeah, [i told you a|tell your] story walking. (?)"
rachel,i was just going to say that i left my keys.
ross,"oh, (door is locked) holy moly are we in a pickle now."
phoebe,where is everyone? they're forty minutes late.
joey,"i know, u-uch."
phoebe,"i'm starving. i know we were coming here tonight, i ate nothing all day."
joey,"what about me, he? only had one lunch today."
phoebe,"yes, they are expected presently. yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing."
joey,"no, they're comin', we're waitin' right here."
phoebe,"joseph! (to waiter) thou needn't worry, they shan't be long."
phoebe,one really does have a stick up one's ass. doesn't one?
monica,"how can you smoke in this day of age? do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling."
chandler,"i messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking."
monica,so what? don't you have any will power?
chandler,will power? i've watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs (?) without taking the tin foil off.
monica,you said that was sexy!
chandler,"'kay, look: can we just drop this? i'm not gonna smoke again."
rachel,ok.
rachel,i thought it was ross.
rachel,there isn't. there is totally isn't.
rachel,"all right. look. gavin...i...i guess i felt guilty that you were here, which i shouldn't. you know ross and i are not in"
rachel,yes
rachel,people keep saying that. oh i'm sorry gavin
rachel,so seriously...rodeo clown?
phoebe,"""no time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!"" thank you!"
phoebe,hi hi...oh you have got to sing.
monica,no i told you i can't.
phoebe,but you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.
monica,what have you heard me sing?
phoebe,all the time when you're cooking.
monica,what?
phoebe,"yeah you're always singing ""yummy yummy yummy, i've got love in my tummy"""
chandler,"you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work!"
ross,"thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave."
chandler,why?
ross,"because, i'm finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it."
chandler,but i didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
ross,"i'm sorry chandler, but this, this is really important to me."
chandler,"fine, i'll give the suit back."
monica,"(to chandler) hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (she has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling chandler's beard.)"
chandler,santa? really?
monica,"yeah, is that okay?"
chandler,did your dad ever dress up like santa?
monica,no.
chandler,then it's okaaay! (they kiss.)
chandler,"you know what, everybody? go home. you should be with your familys. it's bad enough that we're working new year's eve."
chandler,"good, god's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door, turns around and sees wendy) you're not gonna go?"
phoebe,phoe-be!
rachel,"honey, i don't know how to tell you this but, erm...but if something were to happen to ross or myself...[both of them knock on the wooden table]erm...you wouldn't get the baby."
ross,"well, we haven't officially asked them yet, but, we would want monica and chandler."
chandler,i can't believe you want us to raise emma!
monica,"yeah, oh my god..i'm so moved."
rachel,"amy, see, we're alot closer to monica and chandler. we see them everyday, and truthfully, honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby."
chandler,"you know guys, i gotta say this, this means so much to me. that you'd trust me, with your child...i mean, we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own, and i've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but...that you two....that you two..."
monica,"ok...it's time for dinner! erm...everyone, we're using our fancy china, and erm, it's very expensive...so pleaaase be careful."
ross,"whoa.....whoa......[laughs, then almost drops the plate but catches it. his expression turns serious.] whoa!"
monica,"ok er...just to be clear, comedy with the plates, will not be well-received. [monica pinches ross' arm. ross flinches.]"
joey,hey!! how come my plate is less fancy than everyone elses? do you not trust me with the fancy plate?
monica,"no!!! honey that's...that's a special plate! see, it's a game! whoever gets that plate, wins!"
rachel,"monica, is ross' sister."
rachel,"listen. sudden change of plans. my maternity leave just ended. they told me that if i didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me."
ross,"what? no, that's illegal. i'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even..."
rachel,"alright, alright. calm down norma rae. they didn't actually say that. i'm just afraid if i don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out."
ross,what about emma? we don't have a nanny.
rachel,"i know. you know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. can you please just take care of her for today?"
ross,absolutely. just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
rachel,"come on, i don't know what else to do."
ross,"fine, fine. (to emma) we'll have fun, won't we? yes, we will, yes we will. (gives her a kiss, and the pink bow tapes itself to his head.)"
rachel,ross?
ross,huh?
rachel,you're pretty.
chandler,"whatever i decide to do, i'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. it's gonna be a while before i make a living at it. maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family."
ross,so you have to tell monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
chandler,yeah.
ross,(hugs chandler) good-bye.
monica,"(enters) okay, it's baby time. pants off bing. (sees ross) didn't see you there geller."
chandler,"yeah, ross is here so..."
ross,"yeah, and i was really hoping that i could hang out. what do you feel like doing?"
rachel,"oh no, please i don’t care enogh about you to bug me. in fact, from now on, i’m going to take the high road. and i’m going to be very, very nice to you. you're mama’s boy starting right now."
monica,hey rach.
rachel,hi.
monica,you’re ready for your birthday lunch?
rachel,"i am. oh but first, monica, i would like to introduce you to my very talented colleague and more importantly my wonderful friend, gavin mitchell."
monica,please to meet you. so you’re coming to rachel’s party today?
rachel,"oh no no no no. gavin, cant. he’s already has plans. mostly likely with his mother."
rachel,why did you invite him? i can’t stand that guy.
monica,you're just being so nice to him.
rachel,i was faking it. can’t you tell when i’m being fake?
rachel,"hey mr phillip, nice suit."
ross,"oh dude, don't worry about it, i found an unattended maid's car. we're way ahead of the game."
ross,oh my god.
chandler,what?
ross,there's something new in the bowl.
chandler,"look, we have enough, just walk away."
ross,"no, but i want...i want the pinecones!"
chandler,there's a forest right outside.
ross,it's not the same.
chandler,"ok, go quick!"
ross,(to the receptionist) thank you for a delightful stay.
ross,"oh, my maple candy!"
phoebe,(singing) food here at 'javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'javu' ...will kill you..
monica,"thank god, it's just you! i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall."
phoebe,"you'd better get back in that kitchen monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself."
monica,"ok, you have to stop playing now."
phoebe,"oh! i'm sorry rachel, i don't have time for your childish games, ok? i still have to go find something incredible to wear so i can beat mike at ""who's more over who""! (at which she walks away)"
rachel,"(to charlie) hey, hi! hey, where've you been?"
rachel,"(pretends to be stunned) oh! wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? well, that's so weird! phoebe and i were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. god it's just such a small world!"
rachel,"oh god. you did. you heard. ok, listen, let me explain."
rachel,(after a pause) yeah.
rachel,"yeah! that's phoebe. that's phoebe. you know, she just wants them all! it's like she's a nympho!"
rachel,yeah...
rachel,(looks ashamed) i try...
ross,(to the still half asleep professor) oh my god! you really want me to be the keynote speaker? thank you! (hugs him whilst still on his lap)
joey,(impressed) wow! you look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! which is like the highest level of hotness!
phoebe,are you sure? because i'm really dreading going to this party.
joey,then don't go!
phoebe,"mike knows i'm coming, and if i don't show up he'll think it's because of him! and i don't want to lose face! that's a very serious thing in my culture."
joey,"alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over mike. and afterward you come to my place and i'll get you good and drunk!"
ross,"i'm sorry, i'm sorry. you were saying?"
rachel,"well, yeah... okay, look it's about me and..."
ross,"oh, not another one! oh my g... and this is moisturiser. it's even harder to clean! why? why do bad things happen to good people?"
rachel,"wow! well, clearly this is not a good time."
ross,"duh, you think? (enters the kitchen)"
phoebe,"okay, bye. alright, so mike's on his way over. see, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. point is... i'm gonna take off."
phoebe,"alright... susie, can i call you susie?"
phoebe,"yeah, i can't say that. uhm... susie, i'm gonna be straight with you... mike and i are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. and he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours."
phoebe,"well, i don't..."
phoebe,"nothing, there's nothing wrong with you."
phoebe,"damn it woman, pull yourself together! have some pride, for the love of god."
phoebe,"okay, not a fan of the tough love."
phoebe,"but he didn't really know, you know. he wasn't planning on coming to barbados and proposing to me..."
phoebe,"look, precious... mike's not worth this. you're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, mike's kind of a wang. i mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... he was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? and, i don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend."
phoebe,"(singing) ""ipan stripan, glupi glabi! "" and that is the swedish national anthem! thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)"
rachel,"wow, ikea... what a rich culture. uhm, you know what? i have a friend who is a masseuse."
phoebe,"oh, ja! ja!"
rachel,yah! she's... uhm... not very good though... (phoebe looks devastated)
phoebe,"uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?"
rachel,i don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
phoebe,or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!
rachel,(now lifts her head) phoebe!!
phoebe,you know it's me?
rachel,"for like a half an hour! man, you can lie about sweden!"
phoebe,how can you come here?
rachel,how could you not tell me you worked here?
phoebe,i don't have to tell you everything!
rachel,"yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!"
phoebe,tips not included.
monica,"phoebe, we lost half of them."
phoebe,"so, what? monica, we have the winning ticket! my psychic said i was gonna win, remember?"
ross,weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
phoebe,"as a matter of fact she said that's how i am going to die. (pause ) so, excuse me for being a little skittish."
chandler,"(looking at the answering machine) hey, there's two messages. these could be from work!"
monica,"oh, play them!"
chandler,"ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)"
phoebe,"well, i bet that was very hard for him to do."
chandler,this is..shhh!
monica,"oh god, i am so sorry honey..."
rachel,"oh, it is so unfair. it's like that time they promoted sandra over me at work."
chandler,"oh, is she related to ralph lauren?"
rachel,"no, she was just much better at job than me!"
phoebe,"guys, the drawing is about to start!"
rachel,(to ross) you know what? we should call my mum's house and say goodnight to emma before she goes down.
ross,"why, why would you open it?"
chandler,"well, it didn't say ""this is a virus""!!"
ross,what did it say?
chandler,nude... (ross looks at him)... pictures of anna kournikova. i'm so sorry.
ross,"what... what am i gonna do? my speech is gone, chandler!"
chandler,"it's not gone! i mean, i'm sure you printed out a copy. you have a hard copy, right?"
ross,no! i don't!!
chandler,"well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!"
joey,it's really gone?
ross,yep! i'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
chandler,i just feel awful.
ross,"yeah, well you should! i mean, nude pictures of anna kournikova? i mean, she's never even won a major tournament!"
chandler,"well, i tried billy jean king, but... (ross glares at him) you know, you and monica have the same ""i'm gonna kill you"" look...? i can usually make it go away by kissing her... (ross continues to glare at him and chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss ross)"
ross,get out! (chandler runs out)
rachel,"you know, this happens all the time to my computer at work."
ross,"well, what do you do?"
joey,rach?!
joey,rachel!!!!?
joey,so i can't do anything i like!??!?!?
chandler,hey rach! ah........perfection. (kisses monica) wouldn't change a thing. not a thing.
monica,honey?
chandler,yeah?
monica,about that? erm...i'm going to change.
chandler,but honey you don't have to.
monica,i'm going to get bigger!
chandler,honey i...i love your breasts the way they are!
rachel,argh. ***
monica,"well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! and you know what? it's not just my breasts. my ass is going to get bigger too."
chandler,your ass?!?!?
rachel,"man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!"
chandler,they...do that?
monica,it's kind of a package deal!
chandler,huh! so that's what i would look like if i worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. you're not actually going to send these out are ya?
ross,"eh..actually no, i don't need to because your little ""ross is dead"" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that i'm dead. (silence) oh my god! nobody cares that i'm dead!?"
chandler,"no, come on, you know that's not true."
ross,what are you talking about? you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! i didn't get one response! and i'm dead!
chandler,"well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community."
ross,i can't believe this. not even my geology lab partner? and i carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)
chandler,"alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? that people are gonna post condolences on a website? this is not about people not caring that you're dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief."
ross,you're right. there isn't a decent outlet.
chandler,"right, i mean, come on, i'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come."
ross,exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)
chandler,"ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)you're having a memorial service for yourself!?"
ross,no! that would be stupid! you're having it for me!
chandler,"ross, don't press send, don't press se... !"
ross,"oh, too late, too late! it's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man..."
rachel,"i'm trying to put emma down for a nap, have you seen hugsy?"
joey,original or crappy?
rachel,"oh god, she mu... she must need her diaper changed."
rachel,"oh, that would be great! (sandy leaves for emma's room) i love him, i love him, i love him..."
ross,"oh, come on, rach, he's a guy!"
rachel,"so wh..? he's smart, he's qualified. give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out."
ross,"because, it's weird!"
rachel,why?
ross,what kind of job is that for a man? a nanny? i-it's like if a woman wanted to be...
rachel,"(she's got that ""yeah, try to say it"" look on her face) yes?"
ross,king?
rachel,"(whispering and begging) please? (ross makes a ""whatever"" gesture) yes! sandy you're hired."
rachel,oooh... ***i really can't hear what she says*** come here.
ross,you gotta be at least bi...
chandler,"hey! (joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. chandler waits for joey to finish.) i need you to set me up for a joke. later, when monica is around, i need you to ask me about fire trucks."
joey,ooh. i-i don't know chan. i'm not so good with remembering lines.
chandler,"(can't believe what he hears) well, thank god your livelihood doesn't depend on it."
chandler,don’t you think it’s better for him to think that you’re cheating on me than for him to think that i'm cheating on him? [silence] i heard it!
monica,i don’t want him to think that i'm having an affair.
chandler,alright. i’ve got a plan. i’ll go down the fire escape…
monica,yes. because all good plans start with “i’ll just go down the fire escape…”
chandler,"hear me out, woman! i’ll go down the fire escape, then i’ll wait for a while. then, when i come back up the stairs, it’ll just be like i got back from tulsa. then, joey and i will come in here and see that there is no guy in here."
monica,aren’t you afraid that joey’s going to figure all this out? [silence] i heard it!
chandler,just gonna wait for a little while.
monica,scary pigeon’s back?
chandler,it’s huge!
rachel,"oh my god! i can’t believe you live in that building! my grandmother lives in that building, ida green? no sense of personal space? kinda smells of chicken? looks like a potato?!?"
rachel,yeah! that’s my muppy!
phoebe,"yeah, i’m sorry. we weren’t really looking for anything to happen with you guys. i-i have a boyfriend."
rachel,"oh, it’s complicated. i don’t actually have a boyfriend, but, erm…"
rachel,"i’m sorry, no."
rachel,"oh, sure!"
phoebe,oh my god! you’re giving your real number!
chandler,do not disturb do not disturb! monica (smiles)
monica,is everything all right?
chandler,"everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise. (she hugs him, and she knows what he was doing so she looks at the tv and sees sharks swimming around thinking chandler was giving himself a treat to sharks.)"
monica,i'm gonna go freshen up ok
chandler,ok honey… that was close.
rachel,hello
monica,hey rach its me ok i just got the chandler's room and i caught him molesting himself.
rachel,oh that couldn't have been pretty… but you know guys do that.
monica,yea well the weird part is... he was getting off to a shark attack show!
rachel,nooooooooo!
monica,yes! chandler watches shark porn!
rachel,well watching sharks? are you sure that's what he was doing?
monica,"do you know how many times i've seen him jump up like that, believe me i know what he was doing."
rachel,man sharks… i always knew there was something weird about that dude. but you promised to love him no matter what.
monica,what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone… not if he gets his jollys to jaws!
rachel,"ah! you know what honey guys are just different, they like things that we can't understand, you know i once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and i was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice."
monica,"that's right, because i forbid you to smoke again."
chandler,you forbid me?
monica,mhmm.
chandler,"you know, i flew a long way t see my loving wife? is she here by the way?"
monica,"don't joke (?) with me, okay? i'm very, very upset right now."
chandler,"oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?"
monica,yes.
chandler,"then, i might as well ... (graps the cigs) do this (lights one, exhales). not really sure what to do now."
monica,"well, i'll tell you what we're gonna do: we are already late for phoebe's birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, we're gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex."
chandler,fine. what!?
monica,"sex! this is the last day i'm ovulating, and when we don't do it now, we'll have to wait till next month. (walks towards bedroom)"
chandler,you serious? (follows)
monica,oh yeah!
chandler,"right, fine, i'll do it, but no talking."
monica,"huh, and no cuddling."
chandler,and no kissing your neck.
monica,yeah i do rock that one.
phoebe,ok so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
monica,just a little but...it's just so scary! i don't even know what i would sing...
monica,"""delta dawn"""
ross,"hi! i could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace"
ross,"right, so that's a firm ""no"". i cannot believe this, i just keep striking out."
chandler,"i don't get it neither, i mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed"
ross,this is great. rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and i'm gonna die alone.
chandler,by drowning or...?!
chandler,well...
ross,i know! (he stands)
monica,wait wait! i can't sing in front of all these people.
phoebe,"just pretend they're not even here! it's ok monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone"
chandler,ah. thanks.
chandler,ah. (the phone rings; he answers it) chandler bing.
monica,hi honey! we're all here; we just want to wish you a merry christmas.
phoebe,(simultaneous to the others) ble-blah-blar blargh!
chandler,"ahh, merry christmas; i miss you guys!"
monica,so is it horrible? is everybody working really hard?
chandler,"ah, well no, it's just uh, me and wendy."
monica,wendy? -- that sounds like a girl's name.
chandler,it is. did i... not tell you about her?
monica,"umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about new year's eve. where is everybody else?"
chandler,i send them home.
monica,"ohh, you are such a good boss! is she pretty?"
chandler,"uhh, uh..."
ross,"(in a low voice) answer faster, answer faster!"
chandler,i don't know!
monica,that was me.
rachel,amy!! you've got to stop doing that.
monica,"ok...listen er...i know that you're having a little bit of a family crisis but you don't have to take it out on the plates! in fact i think, that, everyone, should erm...cut their food like this! (proceeds to cut a turkey drumstick in mid-air over the plate) now, see? this way you protect the plates, and let's face it. you have fun."
chandler,no...if crazy plate lady...[catches himself in mid-sentence] if monica dies...then...i would get emma...right?
rachel,"well, actually...."
chandler,actually what?
ross,er...it's just that in that case...then erm...emma would go to my parents.
chandler,what??!
joey,er... who has to die for me to get her?
chandler,"so, if monica's not around, i'm not good enough to raise emma?"
ross,"no, that's not what we are saying..."
joey,yeah! he's lying he looked down! (phoebe nods in agreement)
chandler,"what...what is wrong with me? am i, am i incompetent? because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!"
rachel,"honey, you're taking this the wrong way. we think you're going to be a wonderful parent! it's just that, you're more the...y'know, fun parent."
monica,we're gonna have sex.
ross,i don't feel like having sex. maybe we can watch a movie or something.
monica,let me put it this way. we're having sex whether you're here or not.
ross,pants off bing!
rachel,"alright. now that i'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?"
rachel,"hey, they were popular when i left!"
rachel,"well, i should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?"
rachel,"oh, no no no no. i see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. okay, i've had it for five years, and i know how it works, so why don't you just"
rachel,(sits down in her chair) oh god. you've totally messed with the back support of my chair. how do you fix this?
rachel,"fine, i will. (pushes that button thing on the chair that makes it ""collapse"") alright, fill me in!"
ross,hey.
chandler,hey.
ross,you have a blue tie that would go with this? emma spit up on mine.
chandler,"oh, yeah. but you have to give it back if i get a job. of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits."
monica,"(enters from the bedroom) hi, good morning lover. i gotta say after last night, i'm a little weak in the knees."
ross,here's an idea. you walk into a room...take a quick scan!
monica,right there. (pointing her finger at rachel) that was so fake.
rachel,shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
rachel,still can’t believe you invited gavin. he is just the last person i want to see.
monica,welcome for the party. i’m glad you’re having a good time.
rachel,god i hope he doesn’t show up. of course he’s not going to show. that guy hates me.
monica,does he?
rachel,what?
monica,"may be if he bothers you so much, because he likes you. it was like in first grade when skippy lang would always push me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me."
rachel,oh monica. you think skippy liked you? honey all those boys had a fantasy if they can knock you over.
rachel,"oo, ok. thanks you. (molly walks out)"
rachel,do you see what all the guys see in her?
monica,wouldn’t get her out of bed. no more vodka for me.
joey,hey rach. so can i sing happy birthday to you now?
rachel,"yes, sure."
joey,alllright. happy…birth (he saw molly opens the door. so he follows).see you later.
phoebe,why? the only person my playing is bothering is you!
monica,"oh yeah? ok, let's settle this, come on!"
phoebe,(while monica drags her in the restaurant) get your garlic-peelers off me!
monica,"(to the restuarant customers) excuse me, excuse me, hi, i'm monica geller..i'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. ok, i was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands)"
phoebe,"ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) ha!"
monica,"alright, let me ask you this question: how many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again)."
phoebe,"ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?"
monica,ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)
phoebe,"ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands)."
monica,excuse us! (then to phoebe) alright here's a question: who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand)
phoebe,oh...who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)
monica,i'm sorry...
phoebe,i'm sorry too... (they hug)
monica,ooohh... hey! wanna stick around and i'll whip you up some dinner?
phoebe,yeah! as long as it's free! food here is ridiculously over-p...
phoebe,"(smiling, raising her hand) who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?"
phoebe,"you got it! ok. but not on the wine that you made, ok, because i just don't want to go back to the emergency room."
phoebe,david?
phoebe,oh my god! (they hug)
phoebe,yeah. what-what are you doing here?
phoebe,what happened?
phoebe,yeah?
phoebe,"well, it's great that you're back! how are you?"
phoebe,good!
phoebe,"(disappointed) oh, good for you."
phoebe,mike and i broke up.
phoebe,really?
phoebe,"i understand. yeah. ok so then ok, so we're both living in new york, not seeing anyone. that's so not like us!"
phoebe,well... (pause) no.
phoebe,i'd love to.
phoebe,ok. (they walk away together)
phoebe,you're welcome!
chandler,"honey, you've been in there for a long time... is everything okay?"
monica,not really.
monica,i have a problem.
chandler,really? what happened?
monica,"well, i was dancing around, and singing ""no w"
rachel,"oh! phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?"
phoebe,"because i was ashamed ok? i sold out for the cash! and then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401k. but you know... you pay a price. now i'm this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh! paying taxes!"
rachel,"phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! be true to what you believe in! honey, you have principles and i so admire that! i don't have any!"
phoebe,you know what? you are right. i am gonna quit. it's time i took my life back!
rachel,good for you pheebs!
phoebe,ok.
phoebe,"okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and whispers) if you guys have microphones in there too, i didn't mean any of that. i love you."
ross,"haha! got ya! die, die, die!"
ross,"(recovers his composure and starts typing) respectfully, professor r. geller. (hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins charlie on the sofa) hey!"
ross,"hey, how was the met?"
ross,"yeah? joey really knows his art, huh?"
ross,what do you mean?
ross,"(perplexed for a moment) wait a minute... when you guys walked into the met, did you go to the right?"
ross,"(shaking head) oh joey, joey! but still, i mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together."
ross,what?
ross,"oh yeah, it's a good idea!"
monica,"(she hugs chandler) honey, you've been really strong about this, i know how badly you wanted that job."
chandler,"yeah, you know, i really thought i deserved it. (pause) but... let's go win the lottery... i mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?"
monica,(she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants) 131! (they kiss)
ross,"(on the phone) goodnight sweetheart! i love you. and remember, you're daddy's little girl... (covering the phone, to rachel) phoebe's totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver to rachel)"
rachel,"hi mum, put her back on!"
joey,"(sitting on the sofa in front of the tv) rach, come on! they are announcing the numbers! my god, i can already feel myself changing."
chandler,i got that!
ross,"oh, we have one too!!"
monica,"we are on a roll, people!!"
ross,(calling rachel) come on!!
rachel,"(on the phone) mum, please!i know you love your new lips, but i can barely understand you! would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?"
monica,check your numbers! make me rich!
rachel,"(she goes towards the others and she's very excited) guys, you're not gonna believe this! i was just saying goodnight to emma and she said her first words!!"
joey,and what did she say?
rachel,"well, i usually go... play tetris on somebody else's computer."
ross,i can't believe this. i can't believe this is happening. i have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! ok? i have to stand up in front of all these people. what am i gonna say?
joey,i could teach you a speech that i memorized for auditions.
ross,"i don't think that your monologue from star wars is gonna help me right now, joe!"
ross,wha... what you really think we can do that?
joey,"hey don't worry about that! i mean, ross needs you! and rachel and i will stay and help anyway we can."
rachel,ugh.
ross,"alright, ok, let's do it. (ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) um, i know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... um, and then, then i move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the mesozoic era, the breakup of pangea, hello! (rachel and joey look confused) and then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the triassic."
joey,"oh, oh! any chance any of this happened in a ""galaxy far, far away""? (ross turns aroud and glares at him. joey and rachel decide to leave)."
monica,"ok, mike, enough is enough, now you love phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole ""i never want to get married"" thing and step up!"
monica,"this is monica! i'm phoebe's friend. listen, phoebe is back with david and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say ""yes"" but i know she really wants to be with you!"
monica,"i... i'm sorry, did you say something? i can't hear through all this damned hair! (tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, in vain)"
monica,"you don't tell me what to do! i tell you what to do! just call her. she's at the paradise hotel in barbados. and while i've got you, you've got curly hair. what do you do in humidity? (mike hangs up the phone) damnit!"
monica,"(sarcastically) well, i hope you're happy!"
chandler,"(pretending not to sense the tone) oooh! i hope you're happy too, honey!"
chandler,god why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
monica,i thought i was something that we both wanted!
chandler,"alright look...if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. but the giant ass and the big clown feet?"
rachel,"oh my god chandler! if you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? with the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?"
chandler,what?
rachel,joey! why did you tell chandler that monica was getting a boob job?
joey,because she is!
monica,"joey, chandler knows i borrowed the money."
joey,mmmm hmm! for your boob job!
joey,ok so i'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
ross,hey! what do you guys think about this. ross. the divorce-force.
phoebe,better..
ross,hey phoebs...you know i'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and i hope i was a little helpful.
phoebe,"oh yeah you were helpful! yeah...no, thanks you."
ross,"good, good. yeah coz the more i thought about it, the more i realised i don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you."
phoebe,what do you mean?
rachel,original.
joey,"no, sorry haven't seen him."
rachel,then what's that big lump under your covers?
joey,"it's monica, ok?"
rachel,that's not monica!
joey,"alright!! fine! it's original hugsy! no, now i know that emma wants him but he's mine and i need him.."
rachel,(to herself) oh god.
joey,... she's being unreasonable!
rachel,"(yelling) joey, there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much (joey covers hugsy's ears) oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) it's because it reminds her of her uncle joey!"
joey,it does?
rachel,yeah! and she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much.
joey,really? she... she loves me?
rachel,"oh yeah! but you know what? if you need hugsy, don't worry. emma will totally understand. i won't... but whatever (she leaves the room)."
joey,"ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, i mean rach, i mean if if... . if hugsy means that much to emma then... well she can have him."
rachel,"oooh... you're sweet, i knew uncle joey would step up. (turns to face emma in the the playpen) look emma, look who's baaack!"
joey,"i know, right? (chandler has really big eyes, and nods) wh... wh... why are we doing this?"
chandler,monica says that her maitre d. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
joey,seriously? she actually said that?
chandler,yes! am i crazy to be this upset?
joey,nooooo! being funny is your thing!
chandler,yeah!
joey,"without that, you just got ""lame with women""."
chandler,"ye.... (stops because he realises what joey just said, and stares at him. at this moment monica enters)"
monica,hi! there you are.
joey,"(sees monica) fire trucks! (chandlers eyes double in size and he turns to monica who doesn't understand what's happening. then he turns back to joey, who says ""you're welcome"" without a sound)"
phoebe,oof...
phoebe,"oh, wait, wait!"
phoebe,"no, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) uhm... remember when you asked me if i was seeing someone and i said no? well, uhm... i am. his ... his name is mike."
phoebe,"yeah, i should have told you."
phoebe,"i'm sorry, i'm sorry."
phoebe,i am happy.
rachel,great. [gives thumbs up]
phoebe,"wow. so that's great. you, bill, ross and emma are going to be so happy together. what were you thinking?"
rachel,i don’t know. he was cute and he liked me. it was an impulse.
phoebe,but what about ross? what about your moment? don’t you want to talk to ross about it?
rachel,"no, no, ‘cos i know exactly how the conversation is going to go. “hey ross”, “you know, i think that we had a moment before” [as ross] “yeah, um, me too” [as herself] “well, but i’m not sure i really wanna do anything about it!” [as ross] “yeah, um, me, um, neither.” [as herself] “ross, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we’re really feeling?” [as ross] “yeah, that works for me, um, um.”"
phoebe,"yeah, i see what you mean. by the way, nice ross imitation. but your rachel was not whiney enough."
rachel,hey!
phoebe,better!
rachel,"the point is: maybe i should stop waiting around, waiting for moments with ross. i should just move on with my life."
phoebe,"so, really? are you moving on from ross?"
rachel,"dunno, do i have to decide right now?"
phoebe,you kinda just did. that guy’s gonna call you tonight. ross is going to pick up the phone. that’s a pretty clear message.
rachel,"oh my god! ross!! ross is gonna pick up the phone! ah, i have to get my number back! oh my god! he’s gone!"
phoebe,"[as rachel] “ah, i have to get my number back!”, “oh my god! he’s gone!” dead on!"
ross,so soon?
monica,eww are you talking about my bother.
rachel,yeah i didn't disguise that very well did i.
joey,(enters) hey
rachel,(sits down) hi
joey,listen to this... i went out with this girl last night and half way through our date i realized i already slept with her.
rachel,so basically you've slept with all the woman in new york and now you're just going around again.
joey,well that's not even the weird part… i don't think she remembered sleeping with me.
monica,but you don't remember sleeping with her.
joey,"yeah but she should remember sleeping with me i am very memorable, you guys know."
rachel,"what, how do we know, we never slept with you."
joey,and who's fault is that.
monica,"what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night"
joey,hey! i never have an off night ok although sometimes when i'm a little bloated i don't feel very sexy but even then i'm better then most!
monica,honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.
rachel,"yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other."
monica,"oh good, i hate it when you do that"
chandler,and lots of kissing your neck.
ross,"okay, well the ??? is not home."
rachel,no. uch.
ross,"oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. and she has the keys."
rachel,"alright, i can't, i can't wait that long. you have to do something--knock that door down!"
ross,"i would, but i bruise like a peach. besides, y...you know, everything is gonna be fine. the baby's sleeping."
rachel,what if she jumped out the basinet?
ross,"can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped."
rachel,"oh my god, i left the water running."
ross,"rach you did not leave the water running. please, just pull yourself together, okay?"
rachel,"ah, did i leave the stove on?"
ross,"you never cooked since 1996. (actually rachel cooked in ""609 - tow ross got high"", first aired 1999-11-25.)"
rachel,"is the window open? because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there."
ross,"oh my god, you know what, yeah, i think you're right. i think .. listen, listen!"
rachel,ubb.
ross,"a pigeon, a pigeon. (previously scared rachel turns away) no, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. landed on the stove and caught fire. the baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. the eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. baby and bird still up lays (?) are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment."
monica,"hi! i'm monica and i'm gonna be singing ""delta dawn"""
phoebe,can you totally see through her shirt ?
monica,"""to take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"""
joey,"hey, i need your help."
chandler,"wow, it seems serious. what seems to be the problem, ashley judd?"
joey,"look, i'll get new headshot taken, all right, so i want to get my eyebrows shaped"
chandler,"i am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!"
joey,"you may be a sissy but i'll still (pound you out on ground). all right, it hurts so bad, i could only let her do one"
chandler,it’s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
joey,"all right, look, you got to help me out, ok? look, i have the magic marker, i want you to fill in the skinny one so"
chandler,"ok. first of all, this is green!"
joey,what the hell am i supposed to do!
chandler,"all right, i will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what i am about to tell you."
joey,"what, what."
chandler,"ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well i earned mine"
ross,"(in the same low voice) answer better, answer better!"
chandler,"i don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague."
monica,what does she do there?
chandler,"oh, she's regional vice president; she's... just below me."
monica,she did what?
chandler,be-low me!
joey,"ahh, wait, is wendy the runner-up miss oklahoma?"
monica,*what*??
chandler,"well, she... she didn't win..."
monica,"alright, well, maybe i should let you and the second prettiest girl in oklahoma get back to work."
chandler,"well, second prettiest that year; i mean, of *all* the girls in oklahoma, she's probably..."
rachel,"(interrupting him) oh chandler, stop talking!"
chandler,"honey, there's really nothing to worry about."
monica,okay.
chandler,i'm serious!
monica,okay!
chandler,merry christmas.
monica,merry christmas.
ross,"yeah! and we wanna make sure that emma also has someone like monica, who's more of a disciplinarian...someone who can be firm, and strict."
monica,that's not how you see me is it?
phoebe,"no, you're all about the fun. (phoebe is cutting her food like monica told everyone to)"
chandler,"look, i may not know alot about babies, but you really think i'm not capable?"
ross,"no...you both are equally capable. it's just that you're strongest, when you're together."
chandler,"ok, so if we both had emma, and i die [knocks fist on table] she'd have to give her up."
ross,sure! monica would have to give her up.
joey,"i lie better than that right? (phoebe gives joey a ""of course!"" look)"
chandler,"so...so let me get this straight. so my two friends die, i get emma, then my wife dies, then emma the one-tiny-ray-of-hope left in my life, gets taken away from me?"
monica,hey...there you are. you disappeared after dinner.
chandler,"oh, did somebody miss me? is there a child to raise poorly?"
monica,ross and rachel don't know what they're talking about! i mean it's not like they're so responsible. emma as a product of a bottle of murlo and a five-year-old condom.
chandler,y'know but they're right. i'm not a strong father-figure and i never will be.
monica,no....you learn these things. you grow into it.
chandler,"yeah, but it's not who i am. everything they said is exactly why i was worried about having a kid. and it's true! and, look, everybody knows it."
monica,i don't know it! i want to have a kid with you because i think you're going to be an amazing dad. at the fun parts and at the hard parts.
chandler,"oh yeah, well, can you picture me saying, ""go to your room! you're grounded!"""
monica,(to ross) sorry. (to chandler) but i kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
chandler,"oh god, i have to tell you something. you're not pregnant."
monica,what are you talking about?
chandler,that thing that i have to do to make a baby. i faked it.
monica,what!? you faked it?
ross,"you know what? i don't need a tie. i mean, it's better, open collar. you know, it's more casual (he leaves.)"
phoebe,"joey, listen. i can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. yesterday i was a nurse, and today i'm a waitress at a cafe?"
joey,"oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. it's okay."
phoebe,"well, it's not okay, because i gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. and now suddenly i'm the waitress? that's gonna confuse my fans."
joey,"maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress."
phoebe,"uhuh. because i'm a single mother, supporting my two children."
joey,nice.
phoebe,wait a minute. dr. drake ramoray and i work at the same hospital. wouldn't i come over to say hi to him?
monica,"hey rach, somebody got you a shoes."
rachel,oh give me. (she opens the box)wow…argggg(she throws the box away) my god….
phoebe,careful. theses are my rat babies.
rachel,"grrr, you brought rats to my birthday party?"
monica,"(sitting up straight, looks like paralysed) so this what a stroke feels like."
phoebe,"i had to bring them. we killed their mother. they are our responsibilities now. you know they require constant care. you should that rachel, you’re a mother."
rachel,you’re comparing my daughter to a rat?
phoebe,no. seven rats. (turns to mike) i think we should take them home. we need to feed them.
rachel,what? you are going to leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
phoebe,"i’m sorry rachel. but i’m not like you, ok? not everyone could afford help."
ross,(to chandler) hey. where the hell is joey and molly? i asked you to watch them.
chandler,(in helium voice) i’m sorry. i got a little preoccupied.
ross,"look. we have to stop them, before something happenes."
chandler,(helium voice) right behind you big guy.
joey,"so you see molly, what people don’t understand, is that acting, is a discipline. it takes a lot of hard work."
rachel,hey!
joey,hey!
rachel,"joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?"
joey,(touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) oh man! i thought i got it all!
rachel,(looks puzzled) how...how...?
joey,"i was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?"
rachel,uh-huh
joey,"and i couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and i thought...well... how important can that be, right...? turns out very!"
rachel,(to herself) wow...definitely just drake...
joey,what?
rachel,what...how is it going with drake?
joey,oh...i don't think it's going very well...
rachel,what...that scene i saw was so good!
joey,"well, i'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow..."
phoebe,"oh, got it, stay upwind of me."
rachel,"no, that's david."
rachel,(disapprovingly) tip of the iceberg.
chandler,you sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
chandler,"are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression."
chandler,ok.
chandler,i think we've found our sperm!
monica,does seem pretty perfect.
chandler,"yeah, you think so, well? should i ask him?"
monica,(pause) no.
chandler,"why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!"
monica,"no, that's not it. it's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, i just... i just realized i don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you."
ross,"what, i mean, a little, but no, what, go on."
ross,"(slowly) yeah. but you know what? i think you should give joey a chance. i mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else."
ross,"and if you think about it, i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. you know, that's the kind of guy joey is."
ross,that was going to be my next argument.
joey,hey!
ross,hey!
joey,(to charlie) you're ready?
joey,"(aside, to ross) hey ross! that art stuff worked, you hooked me up."
ross,glad i could help man.
joey,"although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... (confidently) i made it work."
chandler,(picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in) it is not okay that i'm aroused by this now.
chandler,"hello? oh hi, doctor connelly. (pause) no, she's not here but, you know, i can tell her. should i be sitting down for this? (his smile fades as he hears the answer) oh. (pause) well, so what does that mean? (pause) ok. ok, thank you. thanks. (hangs up)"
rachel,"she said ""gleba""!! (she celebrates)"
monica,make me rich!!
rachel,(to ross) isn't that amazing?
ross,"oh yeah, no no no...that's great!"
rachel,why-why aren't you more excited?
ross,"oh, rach...oh...""gleba"" is not a word."
rachel,"oh, but of course it is!"
ross,"okay, what does it mean?"
rachel,i don't know all the words.
ross,"i'm just, i'm just glad i didn't miss my daughter's first words (goes back to checking the tickets)."
ross,"yes you did, gleba is a word!"
ross,"ok, use it in a sentence."
rachel,"ok... ""emma just said gleba""!"
ross,it's not a word!
rachel,"okay, okay, okay, fine, i'm gonna look it up (she goes and picks up the dictionary)."
ross,"oh, oh, ok, great. you know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt...."
rachel,"(searching the dictionary) alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... (excited) gleba! ha! here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi."
monica,"phoebe is going to say ""yes"" to david. see, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!"
chandler,"phoebe is going to say ""yes""? that's, that's great!"
monica,"no it's not, b'cause she's still in love with mike!"
chandler,and there's not chance that will work?
monica,"no, i called him. it's not gonna happen."
chandler,(pointing at her) oooooooh! meddler! meddler!
monica,"well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, i wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!"
chandler,this vacation sucks!!
joey,"i'm so bored! stupid rain, we... we can't do anything."
rachel,"well, i've brought some books. we could read."
joey,"hey, it hasn't come to that yet."
joey,(stopping the waiter) hey hey hey! don't mind if i do!
joey,"hey rach, do you feel like going to a convention?"
rachel,we can't. we're not pharmacists!
ross,"well, i know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but...is that really you? i mean can you honestly picture yourself in a volvo?"
phoebe,they are awfully boxy...
ross,i don't know...you'd be so bored with marriage. i mean it's so...normal.
phoebe,uh huh.
ross,"hey hey, can i help?"
chandler,"well! we er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul...but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky."
ross,"you know sometimes your words, they hurt."
joey,hey eh..where do you guys want this?
rachel,"yeah..seriously coz this is really heavy. (she suddenly lets go) i mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys."
phoebe,just one last time erm...the marriage thing...there's no wiggle room? none at all?
phoebe,right. except that i do want to get married.
phoebe,someday.
chandler,aaaaand.......hernia.
phoebe,i haven't exactly had a normal life and i never really felt i was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.
phoebe,"because i just didn't know how much i wanted it. and i love you, and i wanted to live with you."
joey,look forget it forget it... i can't do it.
rachel,are you gonna... you're going to take hugsy away from a little child?
joey,how do you think i got him in the first place?
monica,"alright you two, i'm gonna go to the bathroom. now i don't want anything going on while i'm gone. here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and ross doing it."
phoebe,"i know, i want that too, but is that going to make it too hard?"
monica,"(running back into the room) kiss him, you fool!!"
phoebe,what?
monica,didn't you hear that speech? if you don't kiss him then i will!
phoebe,"oh, i missed you so much! (she kisses mike)"
phoebe,who is this?
monica,"hi, that's what i'm doing for phoebe!"
monica,excuse me?
monica,"hey, at least i knew where my guy was."
monica,you didn't hear the speech!
monica,"hey, it was very moving! you're just heartless!"
phoebe,"well... but david, just... i just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things i've ever had to do."
phoebe,"of course, yeah.(they hug and phoebe sighs... a little after that also david sighs and makes his way to the door) you know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate..."
phoebe,"i mean... (david kisses phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the door and turns around again)"
phoebe,yeah?
phoebe,"well, if that's what they do in minsk... (they kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... david turns to the door) in new york... it's... (and then david grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... they kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)"
rachel,(in a tearful voice) oh... oh boy... (she turns around and sees ross) hi...
ross,(very worried) is everything allright?
rachel,"oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful."
rachel,i can't... i can't hear it again.
ross,"and i'm fine never having heard it... (rachel looks at ross in a ""why do you say that"" manner) rach, can i... can i see you for a sec?"
rachel,yeah! (to sandy) excuse me... (she walks to the kitchen with ross and sighs)
ross,do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? huh? i haven't cried that many times since i moved in.
rachel,"look, ross, he's just... sandy is just sensitive, that's all."
ross,"(picks up a cookie) okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. he is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)"
ross,"okay. thanks, er, for the beer."
ross,"ah, yeah, good times."
ross,ohh. [relieved that mike has gone]
phoebe,"hey mike, it’s me. listen: is ross near you?"
phoebe,"well, you have to go back in."
phoebe,"i’m so sorry, honey, but, okay. rachel gave this guy her number, and, erm, she does not want ross to answer the phone, so you have to intercept all of his calls."
phoebe,[to rachel] he says that he can’t do that
rachel,"oh, give me. [rachel takes the phone of phoebe] hi, mike! hi, listen, i know this is a lot to ask, but you know what. if you do this, ah, phoebe will do anything you want. seriously, i’m talking dirty stuff."
phoebe,"alright, give it here. [phoebe takes the phone] hello? i'm sorry about her, but, she wasn’t wrong about the dirty stuff."
phoebe,"oh, oh, mike! bye. [hangs up]"
ross,hi!
ross,w-why? [blocking route of entry]
ross,"[exasperated] but, you left!"
joey,"wow, that didn’t take long. i thought you said tulsa was a three-hour flight?"
chandler,"well,… you’re forgetting about the time difference."
joey,interesting… all right i'll go out with her again and try to get past it (reaches for the chips) oh salt bloaty!
monica,"joey, joey."
joey,what?
monica,you don't think sharks are sexy do you?
joey,no… (pause) wait a minute what was the little mermaid?
phoebe,it's open.
ross,hey!
phoebe,hey! mike called were going out again! yay! yay! (she dances around with happiness)
ross,"yay! (he continues the happiness with her by dancing around) quick thing, i went to talk to mike."
phoebe,what? wha-wha-wha-did you do ross!
ross,"oh boy you got mad at that part. i went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me blah, blah, blah, and i ended up telling him that…"
phoebe,what!
ross,umm… that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named vicrum.
phoebe,what! why?
ross,well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
phoebe,(walks towards ross) if you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend i swear to lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers right now!
ross,"well phoebe, i think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about vicrum, his a kite designer (he makes a wow face) and he used to date oprah. (he makes another wow face)"
rachel,"boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true."
joey,maybe we should just eat now.
joey,"wha-a how about this: another table leaves, right? but there's still some food left on their place, okay, what's the restaurant's policy about people eatin' that?"
joey,but it happens? (waiter leaves) i'm gotta go to the bathroom.
phoebe,"no, you can't go. no-no-no, i can't hold this table on my own. if they ask me to move, i cave."
joey,"if you ask me to stay, i'll pee. (leaves)"
phoebe,"okay, fine, i'll move. alright, you don't have to manhandle me. (gets up) where? (he points at a smaller table) okay. thank you. wach."
joey,"(returns to their old table where elderly people are sitting now, sits) finally you guys made it. (looks up, turns left to phoebe's chair) pheebs, who the hell--uhuhh!"
monica,spend more time with the tie. that'll make a baby.
chandler,"look, i can't do this. i can't make luv to you while we're fighting this way."
monica,"oh sure, now you're mister sensitivity. but when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral"
chandler,"that was a celebration of life. alright, look, i'm not gonna do this. alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?"
monica,"no, you're right. mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. huch. for what it's worth, i'm, i'm sorry. i shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. so you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world."
joey,oh my god!
chandler,"yeah, well, i guess you don’t need my help victor victoria!"
joey,"ok all right, no, no, no, no, i do, i do, i do, i need your help, but chandler i don’t know if i can take anymore"
chandler,"oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera and my gentle self-loathing touch."
monica,"""take me to the mansion in the sky-y"". i am sorry, the song is over. did you see me out there?"
phoebe,every little bit of you!
monica,"i can’t believe i did this. i can’t believe i'm singing for the people, and they liked me! hey, did you hear that"
phoebe,"mon', not that you didn’t sound good, but..."
monica,good? didn’t you hear them...i was great! thank you so much for making me do this. that’s is the best gift ever.
ross,"but, what’s great is that you don’t mind talking about it."
ross,uh-ah!
ross,(pfew). good choice ross.
rachel,"oh, hey! hi, there you are, i’ve been looking for you everywhere!"
ross,"oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here i am."
rachel,"listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o’ clock. so i was hoping you and i could have a"
chandler,"merry christmas, you guys!"
phoebe,"(simultaneous to the others) blah blargah, blar-blab."
chandler,"(hanging up the phone) the wife says ""hi!""."
chandler,"ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and i are alone, that something is gonna happen."
chandler,"this is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie."
chandler,"whoa-ho, back off, missy! (he takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)"
chandler,i don't know; i'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (she lets go of his tie) wait a minute... am i sexy in oklahoma?
chandler,"(flattered) no,... no... (realizing) no! (he quickly gets several steps away from her.) look, i'm, i'm married!"
chandler,i'm *happily* married.
chandler,"right. so, i'm sorry..."
chandler,"well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. she's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... you know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. but, what i have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us."
chandler,"i mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!"
monica,really?
chandler,you kidding? you're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (she jumps up and kisses him.) (breaking the kiss.) whoa! whoa! whoa! what's going on? you and i just made out! you and i are making out?
monica,can you hear me say you're grounded?
chandler,you said that to me last week.
monica,how hard is it? no shoes on the furniture!
joey,argh. the producer from days of our life left me a message on the machine asking why i wasn't at the parade! they say everybody is very pissed off at me and they all got to meet santa! [whining]
phoebe,"it's ok. i thought of the perfect lie for you. it's easy to remember and it doesn't invite alot of questions. you weren't at the parade, because you had a family emergency."
joey,oh...i like that! yeah! i wasn't at the parade because i had a family emergency.
phoebe,ooo...what happened?
joey,er...my sister's raccoon came.....
monica,wha...wait what are you doing?
joey,setting the table.
phoebe,i thought it might be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
monica,oh..how nice! maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress
ross,"hey dude, you ok? sorry bout before."
chandler,"no, no that's ok. you're totally right i don't know anything about disciplining a child. but...you did hurt my feelings...so, i want you to know that if i die, you don't get joey."
joey,"no, no. see, you and drake are having a fight."
phoebe,about what?
joey,he slept with you and then never called you.
phoebe,and i just wanted a new daddy for davy and becky.
phoebe,"yeah, well, i'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back."
joey,"oh, calm down! she means on the show! we need some new extras around here!"
rachel,"yes. emma and i came in a little early to do research on the presentation. i actually made a few changes, but i think i'm caught up on everything. so ask me anything!"
rachel,"except that! (mr. zelner enters) oh, hello, mr. zelner. we're all ready for our presentation this afternoon."
rachel,"what? i can't do that! i have the baby, and ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour."
rachel,"well, there you go. you win, you win. you get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that i worked here, and then ralph will buy his helicopter, and super gavin will just fly right along side of him!"
rachel,"no, i can't, i have a baby."
rachel,why would you do that?
rachel,that's really nice.
rachel,"then you're not gonna like what's coming. (starts crying) i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. thank you, thank you."
joey,i didn’t go to college.
joey,molly…people don’t study acting…
ross,molly…er…do you mind giving us just a minute?
joey,will the stable boy never get the princess?
ross,"so, what do you think you gonna do? huh? have sex with her right here on my couch?"
joey,"no. the leather sticks to my ass. you know, this isn’t fair. what make you think that i’m just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? huh? can’t you guy open your mind to the possibilities that i actually like her? and i might want something real? (ross and chandler remain silent) .the truth is, i haven’t felt this way about anyone since rachel. ok. i didn’t think i could ever love again."
ross,"er, yea yeah. come on in. molly."
ross,oh ok.
ross,"er…well, joey, i guess, we have no problem."
joey,"it’s like my favourite fairytale come true. the princess, the stable boy and the lesbian."
phoebe,"okay, you start preparing the formula and i will start changing the box. and then we got to put them straight to bed."
phoebe,"well, you know what? there are responsibility now."
phoebe,mate? they are all brothers and sisters.
phoebe,"no. really? (she opened the box)oh my god, get off your sister."
phoebe,"oh my god, where are we gonna do? then, we have seven rats.(mike nods) so what if each of them has seven rats? and each of those has seven rats? that’s like… (counting her fingers) that’s maths i cant even do. what are we gonna do?"
rachel,"joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so i'll give you a compliment?"
joey,"a little. yeah no, i really am worried, you know, i mean i have to make it convincing that i'm in love with olivia."
rachel,so?
joey,so...i've never played that!
rachel,"ooh! honey, it can't be that hard, i mean, you've been in love before?"
joey,uh...well...just once...with you...
rachel,ok...this could be a little awkward...i'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
joey,(looks at her for a moment) what the hell are you talking about??
rachel,"(shakes her head) alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene."
joey,"(approvingly) oh! ok, yeah, i think i can do that. yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so i would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me."
rachel,"(looks touched) joey, you never..you never talked about that before..."
joey,"well.. hey, you know what else i could use? there's a scene where drake sneaks into olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! and he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (in a romantic voice) and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when i would think to myself, my god, she...is... beautiful... (rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz i knew i could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you."
joey,(excited) thanks dude!!!this is great!! (leaves rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)
chandler,i got you something from vermont! (sits down at the table)
monica,(without looking up from what she's doing) besides tampons and salt? (then looks) ooh! my god! maple candy! that's so sweet of you. (opens the box) that's weird...it's empty!
chandler,"yeah, he's better!"
monica,"no, he's not. and if i can't get pregnant with you, then i don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else."
chandler,really? are you sure?
monica,"yeah, i'm sure."
chandler,"(sighs with relief) thank god, because i don't wanna do this either. you know, i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do. you know, i'm the husband, i'm supposed to... bring the sperm."
monica,that is so sweet. i love you. (they kiss)
chandler,so you know this leaves us with...
monica,adoption.
chandler,how do you feel about that?
monica,i think i feel ok about it. actually i think i feel really good about it.
chandler,me too. i wanna find a baby that needs a home and i wanna raise it with you. and i wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
monica,"so this is it, we're really gonna adopt?"
chandler,(smiling) yeah.
monica,"(excitedly) oh my god, we're gonna be parents!"
monica,hey sweetie.
chandler,doctor connelly just called.
monica,"with good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) of course it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) ""doctor connelly just called"". if it was good news you would have said (excitedly) ""doctor connelly just called! "" but so what is it? is there a problem, uh? is there a problem with me or with you?"
chandler,actually it's both of us.
monica,what?
chandler,apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
monica,oh... what does that mean?
chandler,it means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) it means...
monica,chandler?
chandler,"(seriously) it means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us."
monica,(weeping) oh my god!
chandler,i'm sorry.
monica,i'm sorry too.
chandler,"well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out."
monica,(still weeping) i know.
phoebe,(imitating the receptionist's tone) good morning receptionist.
ross,"she's gonna be a scientist! (kisses rachel on the head, very moved)"
joey,(checking the last ticket) damnit! anybody got anything?
chandler,no.
phoebe,i'm still looking through mine...
monica,"just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) no!"
monica,(answering phone) hello? hold on. it's your boss.
chandler,"ah, the ""i'm sorry i rejected you"" phone call. i'm not used to getting it from guys. (on the phone, getting up from the sofa) hey, steve."
chandler,"oh no no no no, i'd love to be somebody's assistant! answering phones, getting coffee, i live for that stuff! and i'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!"
chandler,"me, that guy who just said butt cracks?"
chandler,"ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. i'll see you tomorrow (hangs up)."
chandler,"what? (pause) oh, yeah, i'm gonna be a junior copywriter."
monica,"oh sweetie, i'm so proud of you!"
chandler,does that mean i get the good loving tonight?
monica,you bet! no tv or anything! (she gets up from the sofa and goes to the kitchen area)
joey,"(to chandler) hey, that is so great about the job."
chandler,"thanks, man."
joey,"(walking to a table with many badges on it) i know we're not, but (he picks up a badge) frank medeio and... (picks up another badge) eva trorro... womba..."
rachel,(picking up another random badge) kate miller?
joey,kate miller it is. (he picks up the kate miller badge and sticks it on rachel's breast)
rachel,and... that's the most sex i'm gonna have this weekend.
joey,"in that case should i make sure it's on real good? (he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it)"
rachel,thank you. (they walk away)
ross,"yeah, that's it?"
ross,"oh my god, we did it! (he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly)"
ross,"yes, but i did make a pyramid out of the bath products. this is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. (he leans in, and they look at each other for a moment) that's a pretty necklace."
ross,"hey, what do you say we celebrate? champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)"
ross,"oh my god, i love you."
ross,"that's ben, my son from my first marriage."
ross,yeah.
ross,no. (they clink glasses and drink)
phoebe,"but i don't think i can! it was ok to move in when i didn't know what was gonna happen, but i can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen."
phoebe,are you gonna change yours?
phoebe,me neither. i think i need to be with someone who wants what i want.
phoebe,i don't want it to end either.
phoebe,yeah.
rachel,i'm so sorry phoebs...
monica,we're all sorry...(they hug)
chandler,ah...look on the bright side...i mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! that was here already huh? i love you...(they hug again)
joey,"ah hah! i did it! ha ha! alright...(he takes a box out, about to close fridge, then thinks.) better take all i can carry...who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!"
monica,you're... weird!
monica,oh (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)!
monica,damn it!
monica,and i blame you too.
ross,"it's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! i tell you, when i actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!"
chandler,there you go! someone came!
ross,"ok, ok! i'm gonna go hide! oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)"
monica,"hi, glad you could come."
chandler,"(in a mournful voice) please, come in."
chandler,"oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat."
chandler,at least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)
ross,who is he?
chandler,"some guy, tom gordon."
ross,"i don't remember him, but then again i touched so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)"
monica,"so, did you know ross well?"
rachel,what...? too sensitive to take care of our baby?
ross,"(speaking with his mouth full) yeah, i mean, all things that guy... (looks at the cookie) these are amazing!"
rachel,sandy made madeleines.
ross,"this... this is exactly what i'm talking about. what kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate french cookies, huh? they're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a careful bite from the cookie)"
rachel,"well, i... you know, i-i-i don't know what to say... i mean, i never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. you know, 'cause i gotta tell you ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle."
ross,hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
rachel,"okay, what? what is too sensitive? (there's music coming from the living room. ross opens the door to the living room and he and rachel see sandy play a song for emma on his recorder. rachel is moved by this, but ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the kitchen, angrily. the door he was holding, swings back and hits rachel.)"
phoebe,"hmmm... no, no... no, i can't do this. it's bad."
phoebe,"no, no. no."
phoebe,"look david, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and i-i'm with mike and i really care about him..."
phoebe,(points to david) and you thanks for the face massage. thank you.
ross,did rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
monica,yeah! i think that's great!
ross,"oh really? did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes madeleines?"
monica,"huh, chandler – you’re home!"
chandler,"that’s right. your husband’s home, so now the sex can stop."
monica,what are you saying?
chandler,joey said that you’re in here with another man!
monica,there's no man in here! how dare you accuse me of that? [slaps chandler]
joey,"alright, alright. then maybe you won’t mind if me and my friend takes a look around then. huh! where you at?"
chandler,what’s he doing?
monica,i arranged some pillows on the bed to make it look like a guy!
joey,"bedroom’s clear, although you might need some new pillows."
chandler,"alright, well, i’ll check the guest bedroom."
joey,why do i smell men’s cologne?
monica,i think that's you.
joey,"oh yeah, i rubbed a magazine on myself earlier."
chandler,"nobody here, joe."
phoebe,"i'm not going along with some lie you made ross, no i'm just gonna be honest with him."
ross,good yeah just be honest with him.
phoebe,"yeah i've nothing to be ashamed of ok so i haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. ok i haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave… which he will and that's ok… so i'll just be alone forever you know alright i'll be… it'll be fine… it'll be fine… i'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. oh (takes a deep breath and sits down, knock on the door)"
ross,i'll get it
phoebe,ok
phoebe,"uh huh yeah (stands up) there's just something umm, there's something you should know (pause) vicrum just called."
joey,"uh huh, sure, yeah. how can you not remember me?"
joey,how could you not remember that we slept together?
joey,i dunno!
joey,"come on, come on, search your brain all right… it was (thinks) a certain amount of time ago, i was here you were here, we had sex (starts pointing out the places) here, here, here not there. anything?"
joey,my god woman! how many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this?
joey,"ooooooooooh, i slept with you! and you obviously remember me hey! i still got it. (turns back to hayley) so were good. (she just glares at him) i'll let myself out."
phoebe,"…and i said vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with rachel."
phoebe,yeah well (pause) yeah you know emma's birth certificate might say geller but her eyes say mookurgee.
chandler,mean it?
monica,yah.
chandler,"you are incredible. unless, i...i'm not gonna smoke again. and if i do, i promise, i will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)"
monica,d'you want to?
chandler,"yeah, let's celebrate life!"
monica,'kay.
rachel,"och, god. (seeing emma) oh, thank god, you're okay. i'm so sorry we left you. mom never gonna leave you again. never ever ever again. uch."
ross,great. so let's get going?
rachel,"oh no. i mean it. after what just happened, i'm never leaving her again."
ross,somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
chandler,uhh. you are welcome.
monica,you know what? let's not talk.
chandler,what?
monica,uch. i am still so mad at you for smoking.
chandler,but you said you forgave me. it was just a couple of cigarettes--no big deal.
ross,"oh, yeah, yeah that’s michelle."
rachel,who?
ross,"oh, just this woman i’ve been seeing."
rachel,you’ve being seeing someone?
ross,"yeah, didn’t i mention that? yeah, i mean, we haven’t being going out for too long, but rather there is this"
monica,"well, not anymore."
chandler,but we don't do that.
monica,"i know, i just thought it would be fun."
chandler,how drunk are you?
monica,drunk enough that i know i wanna do this. not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
chandler,(thinks) that's the perfect amount!
monica,okay!
monica,(breaking the kiss) y'know what's weird?
chandler,what?
monica,this doesn't feel weird!
chandler,i know.
rachel,"oh yeah...yeah, right. remember in high school, when i died, and didn't give you my baby?"
rachel,you decorate dad's office and now you're a decorator? ok! i went to the zoo yesterday...now i'm a koala bear!
rachel,suppor...you wanna talk supportive? you didn't even come and visit me when i was in the hospital having the baby!
rachel,i did the first time!
rachel,and...and you know what? you wanna know why i'm not giving emily to you?
ross,emma.
rachel,"oh! whoose side are you on!/ i'm not giving you emma because there is no way, you could handle the responsibility of a child."
joey,"ooooooooohoohooo.......[realizes it is the wrong time and looks away, at his shoes.]"
rachel,jealous of what? of your lack of responsibility? your...your inmaturity? your total disregard for other people's feelings?
rachel,timmy was my boyfriend! and you made out with him!!
rachel,oh god! i cannot believe...i cannot believe that i invited you here today!
rachel,hahah......ahhahah...it's forty-five!
ross,too far amy. too far.
joey,please don't fire my friend. just let me talk to her.
joey,"thank you, thank you. how about i do something for you? tomorrow, i'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?"
joey,"hey, listen pheebs. i was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit drake, you just wait on the tables?"
phoebe,i can't do that. i'm an actor. i have a process.
joey,you're a masseuse. you have a table with a hole in it.
phoebe,"wait a minute, i see what's happening here. you're threatened."
joey,what?
phoebe,"yeah, i'm so good in this scene that i'm stealing focus from you. well, rise to the challenge tribianni 'cause i just raised the bar. come join me up here!"
joey,"(to the director) yeah, you can fire her, but i would call security, she won't go easy."
monica,you faked it? you couldn't have faked it!
chandler,oh yes you can. you just make the faces and the noises.
phoebe,"yeah, okay. i guess you are right. alright, so we’ll just give them away. but to nice families. with children. and reduced-fat wheatbuns. those are bob's favourties."
phoebe,you think i’m crazy?
phoebe,"good. it’s just so hard. it’s hard for me to let them go. i guess it’ll just bring back memories, you know, from, when i gave birth to my brother’s triplets and i have to give them up."
phoebe,"i haven’t told you about that yet, have i?"
monica,hey
rachel,hi. thanks for the party honey. so i help you clean up?
monica,"no way. you had your party, now i have mine."
monica,is everything alright?
rachel,yah. i just feel a little bummed that my birthday is over.
monica,"well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. that jerk gavin from your office didn’t show up."
rachel,yahh(nodding)
monica,we weren’t talking about you. nope. no way to recover. (she goes back inside)
rachel,"well, it was. and you would have seen it if you didn’t show up at (rachel lifts gavin’s hand to see the time) nine thirty! oh god! this party was lame!"
ross,"(sounds excited) hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?"
chandler,we are gonna be great parents.
monica,"and it could be soon. i mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there (they go look through the window) our baby could be being conceived."
chandler,"wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!"
chandler,"hey, zack!"
chandler,"look, i just wanted to apologize for last night. i got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable."
chandler,really?
chandler,"my wife and i have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. we're working on it."
chandler,"you wouldn't know if jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?"
phoebe,"rachel green? (angrily) son of a bitch, she came back?"
phoebe,"(through the door, with a scottish accent) are you ready for your scottish massage? put your face in the hole, lassy."
joey,and i like to think i had a little something to do with it.
chandler,really? what?
joey,"well, before, with the wishbone... i didn't wish we would win the lottery, i wished you'd get the job."
chandler,"(smiling, surprised) oh yeah? (looks towards the kitchen, worried) listen, don't tell monica, she'll rip your heart right out."
joey,oh yeah.
rachel,you know what? there is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
ross,me too. so much for my dinosaur/amelia earhart theme park.
phoebe,"you guys, what was the powerball number again?"
phoebe,we won.
rachel,what?
phoebe,we won!
monica,let me see!
phoebe,don't tear it.
ross,"phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers."
ross,"(embarassed) oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? she... she was... eh... gay."
ross,"ok, odd thing to get excited about!"
ross,hey! high-five! (they high-five)
ross,my wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. she didn't get any fitter.
ross,"i know! it's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? i mean, call, or leave a note: ""hi, i just dropped by to say your wife's gay"""
ross,"and then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?"
ross,(embarassed) me neither.
joey,"well, who knew? pharmacists are fun."
rachel,"i know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home."
joey,"not enough pills in the world, rach. what about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?"
rachel,"well, let's see. there was a really big guy that i was talking to, with the really nice breasts..."
joey,"but what about back home, anything going on there? anybody you like?"
rachel,"(takes a sip from her drink, embarassed) no."
joey,"there it is, you're blushing!"
monica,"(a bit surprised) yes, he is. me."
chandler,"(entering, very upset) ok tommy, that's enough mourning for you! here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)"
chandler,ok! (shuts the door behind tom)
ross,(coming in) i'm dead and no one cares?
monica,i look like a man??
chandler,"please, one ridiculous problem at a time!"
ross,"it isn't ridiculous, look around! no one's here!"
chandler,"you gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and monica... it's probably the way you stand!"
ross,"yes, you're right. still somebody must have seen it... i mean, i went to that school for 4 years, i didn't have an impact on anyone?"
chandler,"oh, that's not true. you had an impact on me, i mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. doesn't that count for something?"
ross,(sceptical) yeah...
chandler,"i'm sure it's somebody for you. now, go hide. (ross hides in the bedroom again)"
chandler,kori? kori weston?
chandler,wow! you look amazing!
chandler,"chandler, chandler bing. i'm not gay, i'm not gay at all."
monica,oh... how are they?
ross,(looks like in heaven) lighter than air... (changes back to serious) but that's not the point. (joey now also enters)
joey,hey!
ross,hey...! rachel and i hired a male nanny.
joey,(looks surprised) really...? guys do that...? that's... weird...
ross,thank you!
joey,that's like a woman wanting to be a...
ross,...a what? a what? what's the end of that sentence?
monica,yes... what is the end of that sentence?
joey,"uhm... a penis model. (monica can't believe what's she's hearing and ross pats joey on the back.) anyway, hey... did you tell chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?"
joey,i guess not.
monica,i can’t believe you thought i was cheating. you owe me an apology.
joey,"you’re right, monica. i’m so sorry."
monica,"it’s an honest mistake. it can happen to anybody. alright, see ya."
joey,"wait, wait, wait a minute. if you’ve just got back from tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?"
chandler,"i climb down the fire escape, and you can’t put that in the closet?"
ross,[looking bored] maybe you should look up fascinating.
ross,i don’t understand what just happened here.
joey,what’s going on?
chandler,i’m sorry. i told you that i was in tulsa because i wanted to spend the night with monica and i didn’t…didn’t know…didn’t think you’d understand.
joey,"what? you think i’m too dumb to know that a husband needs to be with his wife? uh? you think i’m like, duhhh! [taps head with baseball bat – it hurts him]"
monica,joey?
joey,yeah?
monica,i don’t know what to say. we shouldn’t have lied to you.
phoebe,i know but he call's and my heart goes to him. you know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
phoebe,oh.
phoebe,ok i can't do this.
phoebe,"well there is no vicrum, ross made him up because i never really have been in a long-term relationship, i've never lived with a guy, and i've never even celebrated an anniversary so… (pause) if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave i totally understand. in fact i'll close my eye's make it less awkward (she sits with her eyes closed and mike kisses her, phoebe opens her eyes and like a little child says…) you kissed me."
phoebe,so you don't think i'm a total freak
phoebe,"i guess so, can i… can i think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and phoebe pulls back) and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers."
ross,(t
monica,"oh, blablablabaybaybay."
chandler,leave it.
monica,i was just saying that because i was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting.
chandler,you tricked me to get me into bed?
monica,"that's right, i got mine."
chandler,i feel so used.
phoebe,"well, i guess they're not coming. you wanna just order?"
joey,"thank you. (stands up and kisses her lips.) waiter! 'lright, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep uphoebe: risotto with the shaped truffels and the roasted rip steak with the golden chanderelles and a bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff i just said means snails. (hope, *i* kept up.)"
phoebe,tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
phoebe,"both it is, thank you."
joey,"oh, uh, again. can i make a special request: can you bring everything as soon as it's ready? appetizers, entrees, we don't care."
phoebe,you guys are over an hour late. what happened to you two?
ross,i'm so sorry ...
rachel,"we got locked out of the apartment, we ..."
joey,that's a great story--can i eat it?
ross,"how great is this? you are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. oh, i am sorry michelle, that’s"
rachel,"hi, and i am also emma’s mother."
ross,i told you about my daughter.
chandler,and done!
joey,"oh my god! i didn’t feel a thing ! hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around"
chandler,thanks. you wanna see what it looks like?
joey,"yeah, yeah. hey, they totally match! they look great! they look great! how you doing!"
chandler,"yeah, yeah, i think it looks pretty good. i was a little worried i was uncovering a birthmark right about"
joey,thank you so much.
chandler,no problem.
joey,"listen that’s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it."
chandler,yeah.
joey,comb my eyelashes.
monica,you're a really good kisser.
chandler,"well, i have kissed over four women. (they kiss again.) do you wanna get under the covers?"
monica,hm-hmm!
chandler,okay!
monica,wow! you are really fast!
chandler,it bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
monica,we're gonna see each other naked.
chandler,yep!
monica,do you wanna do it at the same time?
chandler,count of three?
monica,one!
chandler,two!
monica,two!
chandler,well i think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
rachel,you take that back.
rachel,take it back!
rachel,hey...man! i work out!
rachel,i do karates.
rachel,bring it on!
monica,put the plates back in the boxes! put the plates back in the boxes!
rachel,did you just push me?
rachel,alright that's it!
monica,forget the bubble wrap! there isn't time!
rachel,crazy crazy crazy crazy! [she says this while messing up amy's hair]
phoebe,oh my god! shouldn't we stop this?
monica,"guys can fake it? unbelievable. the one thing that's ours! besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?"
chandler,"that's actually why. look, i'm starting a whole new career now, and i'm not saying that i don't want to have a baby, i'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while."
monica,like a month?
chandler,or a year?
monica,"really, you want to wait a year?"
chandler,"it could be less than a year. i mean, you've heard my stuff. ""pants. like shorts, but longer."" (pause) it'll probably be more than a year."
monica,"i really wanna have a baby. chandler: yeah, me too. look, i'll just get my old job back."
monica,"no, i want you to have a job that you love. not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration."
chandler,i quit and you learn what i do?
monica,"it's just, i think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. i mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. there's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but i think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons."
chandler,i guess. it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
monica,"it's gonna be really scary. i mean, god. when we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. i mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, i won't have time to clean it. what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? messes up all the ribbons?! what if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? where will all the ribbons go!?!"
chandler,should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
monica,"yes, please!"
chandler,"oh, and i promise, i will not fake it this time."
monica,i wish i could say the same. i'm a little shook up!
monica,"again, you’re welcome."
rachel,"oh, you brought me a present. why?"
rachel,"oh, well okay. well that’s very nice. and you wrote a card. (she reads the card) from gavin."
rachel,oh that’s beautiful.
rachel,no.
rachel,"see, gavin. you are capable of being a nice guy. why did you give me such a hard time?"
rachel,well monica seems to think that it’s because you have feelings for me. s gavin: i do have feelings for you.
rachel,you do?
rachel,"see why? gavin, why? right about when i want to change my opinion of you, you go and (gavin pull her and kiss her). and you do that. (rachel initiates the kiss this time.)"
chandler,"“first i was afraid, i was petrified.” (he stops and laughs at himself.)"
phoebe,hey
chandler,hey
phoebe,i think i left something here.
phoebe,"i know that, but look, we've got the powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!"
chandler,"wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout."
phoebe,"(still very excited) i don't care, i've never won anything before, i can't believe this!"
rachel,"so pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?"
phoebe,it's not all mine. we all get 50 cents.
monica,you know what? you can have mine.
chandler,me too.
joey,me too.
rachel,me too.
ross,i guess if everybody else is...
joey,"(sitting in a chair) hey guys, so i just called the powerball hotline, can you believe it? nobody won."
phoebe,i beg to differ (shows him her cup of coffee and her plate of cookies).
phoebe,"(hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the ""pigeon voice"" from before) coo, again. don't blame the pretty lady. it was not her fault. it was me, the pigeon, coo! (pause) seriously, stop staring at her."
rachel,"no, i'm not blushing, i'm sunburnt! from, you know, the rain."
joey,you like someone. tell me who it is. who is it? (tickles her a little)
rachel,no.
joey,tell me who it is.
rachel,joey! (she walks away; joey goes after her teasing and tickling her)
joey,"come on who? who do you like? tell me. you're not getting away that easy. who do you like, who?"
rachel,"joey, come on! it doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen."
joey,"what? why not? rach, who can you not get?"
rachel,"oh! (pause) ok. ok, you really wanna know who it is?"
joey,"(eagerly) yeah, who is that?"
rachel,do ya?
joey,yeah.
joey,"right, of course. hey, did you guys finish the speech?"
ross,"yep, we got it, we got it. (to charlie) thank you so much."
joey,"alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because i really wanna know who..."
rachel,later! la...
joey,yeah. (they leave)
monica,you are married though.
chandler,"don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)"
chandler,i didn't know ross and you were so close.
chandler,"i'm sure that would mean a lot to him. and if heaven has a door, i'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."
ross,"(he bounds into the lounge room) but you didn't! i'm still alive!! kori, i know this is a big surprise for you. it's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! i mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!"
ross,did you hear that? kori weston had a crush on me!!
ross,"(on the phone) no mum, i'm not dead. i know it's not something to kid about. it was just a practical joke between chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) actually no, even if i had died, you would not be left childless. (pause) monica?"
monica,"yeah, so?"
ross,wow!
joey,really? do you not know chandler?
monica,"is that why he's acting so weird...? he's jealous...? oh my god, that is crazy. it's not like i'm attracted to geoffrey..."
joey,"so what? being funny is chandler's thing... you know, like ross's thing is... (he can't come up with anything)"
ross,science...? academia...? being a good father...?
joey,...no... (he just can't seem to grasp it)
monica,i can't believe he's that upset about this...
joey,"monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and chandler walks in with a pizza)"
chandler,hey!
joey,heeeyy! hey!
chandler,what are you guys talking about?
ross,"uhm... rachel and i hired a male nanny. (joey makes a gesture and sound like ""can you believe that?"")"
chandler,"you got a man who's a nanny...? you got a manny...? (monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. joey realises they also should laugh and punches ross. now all three of them laugh, but very fake. chandler seems happy again.)"
chandler,"i feel so bad. is there, is there anything i can do to make it up to you?"
joey,"you could go to the game with me, even though i know you said you couldn’t, but then you lied to me, tricked me and gave me a bump on the head."
chandler,i’m sorry. that’s the one thing i can’t do. i promised that i’d be with monica.
joey,[looking sad] alright.
monica,you can go.
chandler,[turning around] what?
monica,"you should go to the game. it’s okay, i want you to."
chandler,really? are you going to be okay?
monica,"yeah, it’ll be fine. y’know, maybe i’ll stay and practice the art of seduction."
chandler,"you’re gonna put sweats on and clean, aren’t ya?"
monica,that’s gonna be so hot!
joey,"thanks, here’s ya ticket."
chandler,"thanks. listen, i’m never gonna lie to you again."
joey,okay.
chandler,and i want you to know that no-one thinks that you are stupid.
joey,"thanks, man. [they walk down the hall. chandler looks at his ticket. turns around and heads back to his apartment.] where ya going?"
ross,and then rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
rachel,"n-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and i did what i got to do."
phoebe,and that's judy over there at the bar with emma?
rachel,"oh honey, this is for the best, thus i'm not distracted, worrying about emma, how she's doing at home and i'm being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!"
ross,what?
rachel,"she spit up. judy! she spi...judy! look alive, judy! (they sit down) thank you."
ross,thanks. oh.
rachel,"oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. what should i ha-ave? what should i have?"
joey,(mumbling) never hit a woman. never hit a woman.
ross,y'know this ??? is incredible.
joey,ross bruises like a peach. he bruises like a peach.
ross,"okay, i'll have the fixed salad and the duck."
monica,"ok, for my next song i think i’ll sing something a little more upbeat. all right? oh, how about the pointer"
phoebe,oh you’ll probably take care of that on your hands.
chandler,i am sorry i am late. you’ll understand when you’ll see joey.
monica,"honey, you’re just in time, i’m about to sing another song!"
chandler,really? in front of all this people?
monica,and they love me!
chandler,oh my god!
phoebe,"yes, she gives the people what they want."
monica,"all right, watch!"
monica,"""tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. give in this"
chandler,are those my wife’s nipples?
phoebe,"oh? isn’t that funny? i didn't see that before, i wouldn't have let her go up again."
chandler,i gotta stop this.
monica,"oh, who cares, they still love me! ""i am so excited..."""
chandler,"you, touching yourself, out!"
monica,"eh, we weren't that close anyway!"
chandler,eh! (they start making out again)
chandler,"so, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
monica,"well uh, you and i are just goofing around, i thought, why not just goof around with him."
chandler,"y'know, i don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am *so* bad at this."
monica,i think you're better than you think you are.
chandler,"really? okay, so..."
monica,(interrupting) know when to stop.
chandler,"y'know, i sensed that i should stop. so we're okay?"
monica,"yeah. (they kiss and as she starts to leave, chandler starts to dance. without turning around:) don't do the dance."
chandler,right!
monica,"i can't get married until i get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue."
chandler,"okay, all right, all right, all right! okay! (picks up a blue sweater.) okay, here's something, here's something blue and new."
monica,you're so efficient. i love you!
joey,what are you? out of your mind? let's toss some jell-o on them!
rachel,ew! ew! gross gross!
chandler,"alright! that is it! this is our apartment and you cannot behave this way. now if you can't act your age, then you shouldn't be here at all. now, those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones i picked out...but they're very important to monica...and i want you to apologize to her right now."
rachel,mon...i'm so sorry.
chandler,"ok...that's better. now i want you to apologize to each other, and mean it."
ross,"dude, well done! you know what? if i die, and rachel dies, and monica dies, you can totally take care of emma."
chandler,"oh yeah? well, thanks!"
ross,"so, so, now do i get joey?"
chandler,"ok...but you should know, he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose."
rachel,are you ok mon?
monica,"uh huh. these things happen. i mean it's just a plate, it's not like somebody died."
chandler,"oo, oh well, somebody left this."
chandler,is this yours?
phoebe,no but i like it (putting it on).no. i think i left one of my rat babies.
chandler,"oh, i haven’t seen it. but if i do, well i’ll let you know."
monica,"arrgggg, rat baby, rat baby, rat baby!!! (she runs onto the couch.)"
phoebe,oh may be that’s him.
rachel,"ok. see you, bye."
ross,good night.
joey,night.
monica,i can't believe she's gonna say yes to david. she's clearly in love with mike.
chandler,"you know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that."
monica,"oh my god, he's gonna do it now. please, i cannot watch this, let's go."
chandler,"i think we have some time. have you ever heard him talk? (doing david) ""uh, phoebe, uh, i would be honoured, uh..."" spit it out, david!"
phoebe,"sure, ok, yeah."
phoebe,"oh my god, mike!"
phoebe,"no, mike's here."
monica,it's the humidity!
phoebe,"what are you, what are you doing here?"
chandler,"you know, i don't mind a... male nanny, but i do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)"
monica,"ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!"
chandler,"if i'd known you guys were coming over, i would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)"
monica,"okay, okay... chandler you... you stop it! (monica wipes away tears)"
chandler,what is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke)
monica,"well, i don't know... i-it's... just the way you say it... i mean, you're funny... you have that funny thing. you're a funny guy! (chandler turns to joey)"
chandler,"did you tell her what we talked about? (joey starts laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)"
joey,yeah....
chandler,so those were pity laughs? pity laughs? (joey and ross walk away from the kitchen)
monica,"honey, listen... you have nothing to worry about with geoffrey."
chandler,oh yeah? is he funnier than me?
monica,"well, you're... you're different funny... i mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks..."
chandler,"i do limericks... uhm... there once was a man named chandler, whose wife made him die inside."
monica,"honey, you know i think you're hilarious! come on, you know that joke you told me last week? the one about jerry lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) that slayed me."
chandler,"game’s tomorrow night, joe. [enters apartment]"
rachel,"so, what did you guys do?"
ross,"you know, we just drank some beer…mike played with the boundaries of normal social conduct…"
phoebe,"well, goodbye!"
rachel,"have fun, pheebs! see ya guys. [phoebe and mike leave]"
ross,"rachel, lock the door, lock the door, seriously!"
rachel,"oh shoot, i forgot to pay phoebe for the drinks! [goes outside into the hallway] wait, wait. so, did he call? did that guy call?"
rachel,"yah, i'll have the soup and the salmon."
joey,"and remember whatever comes up first. okay? and hurry, because .."
monica,(entering with husband) happy birthday!
joey,son of a bitch!
phoebe,wher-where have you been?
monica,"well, we had a little fight."
chandler,i would never lie to get someone into bed.
monica,"you used to tell girls you were a kennedy. (being sat down) ooh, uh, thanks. wow, little tight, isn't it? how d'you get a bigger table? you-you had a big table, but they made you move. huh-huh, shut up monica. whoo, i suppose that chandler will have the smoked duck."
chandler,i suppose that monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.
joey,"why are you going? he said, she wanted the shrew! (runs after the waiter)"
ross,"rach, c'mon, emma is fine. you're turning into an obsessive mother. okay, you need to stop."
rachel,y'guys ever heard the story about when rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
chandler,you mean the lully story?
rachel,wow. she does that a lot!
rachel,"what, what, wait a minute! you haven’t even told her you were a doctor, yet? how long have you known her, like"
ross,"i told you it wasn’t long, but there is an amazing connection between us."
ross,are you kidding?
ross,we’ll see.
rachel,"ok, ross, what’s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?"
ross,"i don’t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?"
rachel,how do you know about that?
ross,"through the magic of sight! i was here, putting our child to sleep..."
ross,"when i happened to look through the window and i see you kissing a guy you know, for what? a week?"
rachel,"oh, that’s what this is all about? did you bring her up here to get back at me?"
chandler,let's go! (starts to leave.)
monica,"no-no-no, wait! we need something old!"
chandler,"oh, okay, i have condom in my wallet that i've had since i was twelve."
phoebe,it's alright...you can mourn.
monica,i'm going to go to joey's and get pies.
joey,"actually, not pies, it's just pie."
monica,"i don't care. oh my god, i've lost the will to scold."
rachel,"look, amy...i got a little out-of-control over there. erm...and i'm sorry. you're my sister and erm...if it really means that much to you..."
rachel,"no, i was going to let you use my ralph lauren discount."
rachel,she needs changing...
chandler,"oh no no! i'll get her. i'm super-confident, totally responsible and fourth in line to raise emma./ i'll be right there emma! just let me get my trusty diaper bag here."
chandler,"well, what do you know? i guess, i'll be the one who dies first."
phoebe,hey. does monica know about her broken plates yet?
monica,"you're the most incredible woman i've ever met. how can i lose you? (phoebe looks very flattered) now, i don't actually have a ring..."
chandler,"i wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy."
phoebe,(smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) no!
phoebe,"i love you. but i never needed a proposal from you. i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future."
phoebe,"david, i'm so sorry, i'm sorry."
phoebe,"yeah, i might have said yes, but that would have been wrong."
phoebe,yes! (they hug)
monica,(to everybody) because of our meddling! alright?
chandler,"oh, ain't this nice? it's so quiet, i could just lie here all day."
ross,"hey... i made up that joke and told it to you! (he points at chandler. joey gestures to ross ""what are you doing?)"
joey,not knowing when to shut up...
ross,yep! that's my thing...
phoebe,"no, no, no, no, no... it's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. i was just saying goodbye to an old friend."
phoebe,"no, uhm... david and i did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in minsk. he's only... he's only in town for a couple of days."
phoebe,"no, no..."
phoebe,"oh, well, yeah..."
phoebe,"stop it! stop it, before someone gets really hurt! (they stop and phoebe gets david's jacket and gives it to him) here david, you should just go."
phoebe,"okay, well... guys?"
phoebe,"i'm sorry, i'm so sorry. if you... if you want your key back, i totally understand."
rachel,"oh, around 8:30?"
rachel,then again at 9?
rachel,yeah…
ross,"hello? oh no, she’s not here right now. can i take a message? bill from the bar? okay…bill from the bar. i’ll make sure she gets your number."
rachel,ahhh.
ross,"so, er, so how was it? have you guys, you guys, had a good time?"
rachel,"oh, it’s so much fun. it’s so good to be out."
ross,"ah, rach?"
ross,"(childish) huh-huh, they already know it."
phoebe,"you guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order."
joey,"(returned) no, no, it's okay, i already told the waiter what they want."
monica,why would you do that?
joey,"chandler, control your woman!"
rachel,"(lifts for a toast) okay, as everybody has ordered, i would like to start the celebration and make a toast ... to phoebe. she dropped her sock."
phoebe,aw ... what?
rachel,"n-no, emma dropped her sock."
monica,"mom's here? i wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town."
rachel,"ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground."
phoebe,'s a good toast.
rachel,(to ross) could you please get her attention?
ross,w-oa ... mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)
phoebe,"(getting up) oh, for god's sake, judy, pick up the sock! pick up the sock! pick up the sock! (everybody scared) i'm sorry, was that rude? di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this evening? look, i know, you all have a lot going on, but all i wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. and you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) well, it's too late now."
ross,"well, ??? think that's us?"
ross,"ok, michelle, it’s time to go."
ross,ok.
ross,"you know, if it’s meant to be, i’ll guess it. bye, bye."
rachel,score.
ross,"oh, i am sorry, did you not like her, because i was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on"
rachel,"oh god, i can’t believe you’re making such a big deal about this. it was one kiss, one guy, one time!"
ross,"oh, really!"
rachel,yeah.
ross,"oh, really!"
rachel,oh yeah.
ross,what about the guy from the bar?
rachel,what? who?
monica,that'll work!
chandler,i don't think so.
monica,"okay, now we just need something borrowed!"
chandler,(looks around) here just...take this. (hands her the sweater.)
monica,that's stealing!
chandler,"no, we'll-we'll bring it back! just put it under your dress."
monica,ohh. (rubs her fake stomach.)
chandler,"okay, one thing at a time. (they run out to get married.)"
monica,"listen umm, i've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. i mean, you work, you work really hard for that."
chandler,ehh.
chandler,nope.
phoebe,broke em all huh?
chandler,yup.
phoebe,you going to tell her?
chandler,nope.
chandler,"hey! so, i'm gonna put the plates back. y'know i think you're right...i don't think we should use these plates again for a long time."
monica,like only if the queen comes?
chandler,maybe not even then!
joey,"hey! i did it! i called my producer, i told him i had a family emergency, he totally bought it. thanks for teaching me how to lie phoebs."
phoebe,"no problem. next week, stealing!"
monica,bye plates!
joey,oh...you told her you broke all the plates huh?
monica,what?! something happened with the plates?
monica,i know (she snuggles to him)
rachel,(walking in hurriedly) open your drapes! open your drapes!
chandler,i'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
monica,the sun is out!
chandler,hey! remember when i had corneas?
monica,"ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and i'll get the magazines and the lotion."
chandler,ladies? ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
rachel,nooo!
monica,damn it!
ross,"(from across the wall) walls are pretty thin, guys!"
ross,then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
rachel,"look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, i'm so jealous!"
ross,"finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: gigantosaurus, argentinasaurus..."
phoebe,right! never! never! i swear! (they kiss... the door opens and david comes in again.)
joey,"yeah! allright! hey, hey ross. check it out! sandy taught me hot-cross buns."
ross,really? sounded like three blind mice.
joey,noooo... three blind mice goes like this... (he puts his fingers in position on the recorder)
ross,(looks angrily at joey and points at him) i swear to god...! (joey is in shock)
joey,me! i'm up for puppets!
ross,"okay, okay... how exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?"
joey,"i wanna be mr. wigglemunch. (and makes a ""there"" nod to ross)"
ross,(shakes his head) oh my god!
rachel,that was kind of rude!
ross,"oh, i'm sorry. please apologise to sandy and the snufflebumps for me."
rachel,"you know, he was just doing his job..."
rachel,yeah?
ross,never mind.
ross,"hey, you guys!"
ross,ah.
phoebe,i’ll be right back. i just have to go to the bathroom.
phoebe,"well, this is, this is, this is not over! (on phone) hello?"
joey,"(to chandler and monica) well, what is going on with you two?"
monica,"uch, you see, i'm ovulating."
chandler,"oh yeah, that's what she says. but maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed."
monica,"yes smokie, that is what it was. i just can't get enough."
chandler,(to joey) you not gonna believe this: she lied! she tricked me into having sex with her.
joey,"so? did have sex, right?"
chandler,what's the matter with me? why i'm such a girl?
phoebe,"(returns) okay, that was mike."
rachel,"phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. you're totally right. we are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration."
phoebe,"mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. huh, nkay, i'm gonna take off."
ross,the guy you gave your number to.
rachel,"whoa, how do you know about that?"
ross,"because he called here looking for you. so don’t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,"
rachel,why didn’t i get that message?
ross,what?
rachel,"from the guy in the bar, why didn’t i get that message?"
ross,because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket. do you...do you not look there?
rachel,ross?
ross,i never gave it to you.
rachel,why?
ross,i don’t know.
rachel,oh god. you know what? who you think you are? who are you to decide what messages i should or should not get?
ross,who am i?
rachel,yes.
monica,"eh, you work for that."
chandler,"look, i thought about it too, and i'm sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding."
monica,you do?!
chandler,"yeah, i'm putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do."
monica,"oh, you're so sweet. (they hug and kiss.) oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?"
chandler,"eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, y'know? we'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
monica,you thought about that?
chandler,yeah.
monica,how many kids were we gonna have?
chandler,"uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
monica,what else did you think about?
chandler,"well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old."
monica,"(laughs) y'know what? i-i don't want a big, fancy wedding."
chandler,sure you do.
joey,er...(looks down) yeah...this er...raccoon came in and..er..[makes an action describing the path of the raccoon]
chandler,(to a paleontologist sitting next to him) not to mention the cold sores.
ross,"and that's just the herbivores. i'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development."
chandler,(to the one sitting next to him) really?
ross,"but all kidding aside, in much the same way that homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus..."
joey,"he said ""erectus""!"
joey,"no, he really said it."
ross,... and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus...
joey,erectus?
rachel,homo.
ross,(concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses) thank you!
ross,"oh, thanks guys!"
ross,"well, you know what... i-i'm sorry i'm the only one who isn't in love with gary poppins out there... but i just... i can't... i can't go through with this."
rachel,"oh, come on ross..."
ross,"no! hey, you know what? i'm sorry. i would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with..."
rachel,(sighs) oh... that's true.
ross,thank you!
rachel,"well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it. (ross walks to the living room determined to fire sandy)"
joey,(kind of emotional) i am learning so much from you.
chandler,"well, i'm off to tulsa, so if your maitre d. friend has any funny oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at http://www.hahanotsomuch.com/."
monica,"honey, you can relax. last night at work, geoffrey told this really sexist joke. after that, not so funny anymore."
chandler,"really...? see... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!"
monica,"okay, don't miss that flight. you know i love you."
chandler,i love you too. (monica and chandler kiss. he turns to joey.) and... i like you as a friend. (they hug and pat each other on the back.)
rachel,what?
phoebe,"oh, i love you guys too, but mike got off work early. wait. wait, i'm not t--not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. you know what? i am. bye guys! (waves to the bar) judy! bye."
rachel,"oh thank god, if phoebe's going, can we please take emma home?"
ross,"you know, i think that's a good idea--our babysitter just pounded in another chardonnet. (both get up) bye, y'guys."
monica,bye.
joey,"see ya. well, this is just us."
monica,"so, i'm, i'm probably still ovulating. do you want to give it another try?"
chandler,"so you never had sex with a kennedy, have you?"
joey,"do, do you gonna do it now?"
monica,we don't have much time. once the egg decended the oviduct ...
joey,"no-ohoh. (the bings leave, the waiter comes)"
ross,i am the guy who’s taking care of our baby while you’re out at bars meeting guys!
rachel,"oh my god, i cannot believe this. you know i actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you"
ross,none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! that’s not the point. ok? the point is you...you are the one
rachel,"oh, ross, this is just so messed up! what’s wrong with us? you know when people hear about our situation they"
ross,"uh, clearly."
rachel,"and you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. an maybe this, you know,"
ross,"yeah, maybe not. so what you wanna do?"
joey,hey!
rachel,hi. can emma and i live here for a while?
joey,"ha, oh, of course."
rachel,thank you.
joey,your eyebrows look weird.
chandler,"“jeremiah was a bullfrog. was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but i helped him"
monica,"no, i want everything that you just said. i want a marriage."
chandler,you sure?
monica,uh-hmm.
chandler,i love you so much.
monica,i love you. (they kiss.)
rachel,"(opens her present from ross; it's a dark-red scarf) oohh, i love it!"
ross,really? you're not gonna return it?
rachel,"well, not (the|this) second!"
phoebe,"(at the window) hey look, you guys, it's snowing!"
rachel,"oh wow, it's so beautiful..."
ross,"wow, it really is!"
monica,"""wendy"" is a fat girl name."
phoebe,aren't we done with that?
monica,"okay, fine. let's talk about snow. -- do you think it's snowing in tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?"
chandler,hey!
ross,oh my god...
joey,"hey-heeyyy - look at that, it's a christmas miracle!"
ross,oh!
ross,"(with a frozen smile on his face, realizing something's wrong with jarvis) ok... now... now we're just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)"
rachel,"all right! well, uh... (to monica) we're gonna hit the beach?"
monica,yeah!
rachel,"(to ross, in a flattering tone) it was really... great!"
ross,"oh, thank you so much!"
joey,"yeah, and so funny!"
rachel,oh!
ross,"(puzzled) ok!... all right, thanks! thank you so much, you guys! (to phoebe) oh, i can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!"
ross,"(skating over, embarrassed) ok!... uh... excuse me? yeah?"
ross,hey! (she turns to him) well...? (in expectation)
ross,yeah?
ross,"oh, i can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! i mean... uh, did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?"
ross,"no, it's ok! made me feel like a rock star!"
ross,(joking) i'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
joey,allright. see you later!
chandler,see ya! (he leaves the apartment)
joey,(to monica) did that guy really make that joke?
monica,"naaaa... he still kills me. last night he had me laughing so hard, i swear... a little pee came out."
ross,here goes...
rachel,i can't watch. it's like firing elmo. (ross walks to the couch where sandy sits)
ross,"sandy... hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. i'm afraid it's not working out."
ross,"yeah, uhm... i mean, rachel and i, think you are great... with emma... uhm... we just feel..."
rachel,(from behind the bedroom door) you! you feel!
ross,i... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. i'm sorry. we're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
rachel,"(from bedroom) oh, damn you geller!"
ross,"anyway, uhm...well, i'm glad there's no hard feelings."
ross,"no, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue."
ross,"you know, i'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you."
joey,"nah, just me. all alone. (all the food is served) dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special."
joey,excellent. the shrew in particular was exclusive.
joey,joey! joey.
joey,that's the best birthday ever.
monica,what are you doing here?
chandler,i wanted to be with you. i missed you so much.
joey,"hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?"
chandler,monica.
joey,got ya. (blinks an eye)
chandler,i never want to leave you again!
monica,"but i thought if you left, you get fired."
chandler,turns out they can't fire me. because i quit.
monica,what?
ross,"what, you, you really quit your job?"
chandler,"yeah! it's a stupid job, and i could not stand leaving you. and why should i be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?"
rachel,what do you really want to do?
chandler,(realizing) i have *not* thought this through!
monica,oh my god!
chandler,"i know, i, i should have talked to you first about it."
monica,"no, i think that this is what you wanna do, i think it's great!"
ross,"(realizing his joke wasn't so good, but still giggling) look, i took it too far!"
monica,"(her hair bigger then before) i can't believe it's raining again! oh, it's so unfair!!!"
phoebe,"well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) not you guys. you got it going on!"
monica,"so, what are we gonna do today?"
monica,"(pleasantly surprised) ping pong? (to chandler) honey, they have ping pong! let's play!"
chandler,i don't think so!
monica,(disappointed) why not?
chandler,"because you know how competitive you get and well, i say it's cute, others disagree, and i'm lying!"
monica,i'm not always that bad!
chandler,"oh, yeah? what happened when we played last time?"
monica,(hesitatingly) i punched you...?
chandler,and...?
monica,... phoebe...?
phoebe,... and...?
monica,i clunked your heads together!
ross,why... i... i don't know. (sandy tilts his head again) uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
ross,"i mean, uhm... you know when i was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... you know a-a-and as a kid i wasn't the athlete i am now."
rachel,(from the bedroom) huh ha ha!
ross,"i play squash...! anyway, uhm... i uhm... i always get the feeling he thought i was too sensitive."
ross,"it was hard... i remember... i was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... ""what are you doing with those things? what's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?"
ross,"i know i am! (ross now starts to cry) ...and when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?"
ross,here come some more...
joey,wow! you blow my mind...
joey,aaahh... how much do i owe you?
joey,it's like the cheapest college ever.
chandler,thanks!
phoebe,"chandler, your being here is the best christmas present i could have ever imagined."
chandler,(flattered) ahh...
phoebe,now give me my real gift.
phoebe,(to chandler) thank you.
chandler,"(to monica) here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)"
ross,"oh, hey..."
ross,"(reading off his card) ""a donation has been made in your name to the new york city ballet."" -- how did you know?"
rachel,wha... are you kidding? i can't return this.
chandler,"i... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. besides, this gift still says i love you guys."
joey,mine's is to lilian myers.
chandler,i don't have a *job*!
chandler,"actuary... no. book-keeper... no. topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to monica:) hey, d'you know what i just realized? you are the sole wage earner. *you* are the head of the household. i don't do anything - i'm a kept man!"
monica,"you are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to chandler) hey, here's twenty bucks. -- why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while i'm at work tomorrow?"
joey,"hey! (stands up) as soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! (smiles ecstatic)"
joey,"(disappointed) oh... oh, but that's ok, i'll find someone else to do it... i'll do it alone, but... i don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you..."
joey,"(interrupting her) hey! don't worry about it! it was fine! i ended up having the best time with rachel! i just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on ross's speech... (pulls a face)"
joey,"(bewildered) oh! oh, well! at least we're both having fun!"
joey,"yeah! a little bit, yeah..."
joey,"yeah... i think we do... (sighs, with folded arms)... about what?"
monica,"c'mon guys, it'll be fun!"
phoebe,"all right, all right... i'll play if we don't keep score!"
monica,but then how do we know who wins?
phoebe,nobody wins!
monica,"so, we're just four losers... super!"
chandler,i'm not playing with you.
phoebe,"yeah, i'm out."
monica,(smiling) ok!
phoebe,"mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!"
chandler,she gets crazy! this scar (points to his forehead) is from pictionary!
monica,sure! got to!
monica,aww!
chandler,"(nearly whispering) oh dear god, there's two of them!"
monica,"hell, yeah!"
chandler,(to phoebe) did you know this about him?
phoebe,no idea! i though he was soft like you!
monica,how much were you thinking?
monica,make it fifty!
monica,(nearly shouting) one thousand...
chandler,(interrupting her) ok!
monica,(going through her pockets) no... (to chandler and phoebe) either of you girls got a quarter?
chandler,"honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!"
phoebe,"(picks up a coin from her bra) monica, you call it."
monica,"heads! no, tails! he-he-heads!"
phoebe,tails!
monica,"(angry) ow, what are the chances!"
monica,ha! my point!
phoebe,(smiling proudly) he was a lawyer!
rachel,oh! weather bitch! (turns the tv off)
rachel,"it's open! (joey walks in) hi, joe!"
joey,(downhearted) hey...
rachel,"(worried) what, is everything ok?"
joey,uh... charlie and i broke up.
rachel,"nooooo, why?"
joey,"oh well, she said we have nothing in common."
rachel,"(laughing) oh, that's crazy!"
joey,"no, it's not, we have nothing in common!"
rachel,"... yeah, it's true."
joey,"i mean, she should be with someone like... ross! you know what i mean, he uses all those big words too! man, smart people are dull!"
rachel,"(pretending to be offended) what, hey!"
joey,"(laughing sarcastically) ok, rach!"
joey,"i feel so stupid, you know? why... why do i keep going after the wrong girls?"
rachel,"w-what are you, what are you talking about?"
joey,"oh, c'mon, i mean, there's you, then there's charlie, and it's like... (sighs) what the hell is my problem? oh! (he falls back on the bed)"
rachel,ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
joey,"(sitting up again) i'm telling you, rach, charlie is not right for me!"
rachel,"yeah, i'm not talking about her..."
joey,but then who? the waitress i went out with last month? (gives her a meaningful look)
rachel,you know? forget it!
joey,"(stands up) no-no-no-no, no! who, who were you talking about?"
rachel,"no, i-i-i-i don't, i actually don't know who i'm talking about! so!"
joey,"ok! all right, well... i'm gonna see if i can get a room for the night and i'll... i'll see you later!"
rachel,"yeah, sure!"
joey,you like me? (shuts the door)
rachel,"(nearly whispering) ok, let's not make a big thing about this!"
joey,(shocked) that's a huge thing!
rachel,"not working with me, joe! here's the thing: lately i have been having thoughts (pauses) musings, if you will!"
joey,what... for how long?
rachel,only like a month!
joey,(outraged) a month??
rachel,"what the... dial it down! (joey goes to sit on the bed) listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes i do, i have, i've been thinking about... you know, us! (looks at joey, who's totally distraught) ok, dial it up a little!"
joey,(stands up) i just have one question!
rachel,shoot!
joey,(desperate) what the hell are you doin'???
rachel,"i don't know, i'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... i mean, aren't you just a... little curious... (insinuating) what that would be like?..."
joey,"uh, am i curious? i mean, i am as curious as... as... george!!"
rachel,(puzzled) who...?
joey,"curious george! you know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!"
rachel,"oh yes, of course, i remember him!"
joey,"yeah, he had a paper route."
rachel,"yeah, he did! (smiling) oh, see, this is what i'm talking about!"
joey,"no, i know, yeah i know we're great but rach no... this... this can't happen!"
rachel,but can it... just... happen a little bit?
joey,"(charmed, but then recoiling) no, no! it can't happen at all!"
rachel,"but why, why not?"
joey,"because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? (in a trembling voice) i have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did i ever say no! (sighs) i couldn't do it to ross!"
rachel,but that wasn't gonna stop you before!
joey,"i know, i know! but i've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... (painfully) i'm sorry...!"
rachel,"(regretful) i'm sorry, too! (they look at each other sadly, then she recollects, and puts her hands over her eyes) oh god! i shouldn't have said anything!"
joey,"no! no-no-no-no-no-no! hey! hey, we'll be fine! li... hey, like you said: no big deal!"
rachel,it's not a big deal!
joey,no big deal!
rachel,it's so not a big deal!
joey,yeah! i'll see ya later! yeah!
rachel,ok!
rachel,"ok, i..."
rachel,aaahhhh!
monica,"ooh! i'm sorry! i think, i think, that may have missed the table!"
monica,"ah, yeah!"
monica,"ah, yeaaah!"
monica,ah yeaaaah!
chandler,(to phoebe) do you really find this attractive on him?
phoebe,"(looking at mike) oh, yeah! (turning to chandler) are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by monica, right now?"
chandler,i think this is the first time in our marriage that i've felt like the more attractive one.
phoebe,"c'mon mike, you can beat her! knock that dog off her head!"
monica,"oh, damn it!"
phoebe,(pointing at mike and shouting) i sleep with him!
monica,"(threatening) don't get too cocky! remember i won the last one! oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?"
monica,"no, no, nooo!"
chandler,"okay-dokay, you've each won a game and i've lost what's felt like a year of my life. so everybody goes home a winner."
monica,best out of three?
chandler,should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
monica,"(to mike) serve the ball, chump!"
phoebe,"(to mike) ok mike, better come back mike, better come back."
ross,"ooh, well. ah, i kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that i wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man. (mr. oberblau giggles)"
ross,get out!
ross,"yes, please! (they move and sit down on a sofa) so, what's going on?"
ross,"oh my god, wh-what happened?"
ross,i knew that was him!
ross,"(holding her hand) hey, you ok?"
ross,"oh, professor clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here."
ross,"(standing) ok, gentlemen! please! aren't we a little old for this? i mean, we're scientists, right? we're academics. and most importantly i... you-you will have to catch us first. (he starts to run away with charlie). go, go, go! (the paleontologists starts chasing them)"
chandler,"(exhausted) ok, look! enough is enough!"
monica,"no, i have just to have two more points to beat him!"
chandler,"monica, that was also true an hour ago! i mean, please, look at you! your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!"
monica,i can't just walk away! i've put in four hours!
chandler,but...
monica,"look! you knew this about me when you married me! you agreed to take me in sickness and in health. well, this is my sickness!"
chandler,what about the obsessive cleaning?
monica,that's just good sense!
monica,"(in pain) aww! (she holds her hand, moaning like she's biting back a scream)"
chandler,you ok?
monica,"no, no, no. honey, i'm ok. shake it off! (she shakes the wrist and it's more painful) oh, no! no shaking, no shaking! ooh! ooh! (pause) oh my god! i can't play!"
phoebe,mike wins?
monica,i can't believe it! (pause) i lost!
chandler,"no, you didn't."
monica,what?
chandler,because i'm gonna play for ya.
phoebe,you can't do that!
phoebe,"ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister."
monica,"(to chandler) honey, you don't have to do this."
chandler,"(in a loving voice) yes, i do. now, i may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because i love you."
monica,but... you suck!
chandler,"(still in a loving voice) you're welcome, sweetheart."
chandler,"all right mike, let's get this over with. sudden death. whoever wins this point, wins."
monica,oh my god! you're good!
phoebe,it's like watching porn!
chandler,and that's... how... it's done!
monica,(to chandler) oh my god. that was so amazing! when did you (pause) hold on! i almost forgot (she turns to mike) loser! (back to chandler) when did you stop sucking?
chandler,"i never sucked, i actually didn't want you to know how good i was!"
monica,why?
chandler,i don't know.
monica,this is so great! now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
chandler,that's why!
ross,hi.
ross,"yeah. the bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. (pause) you know, we as a group are not the coolest."
ross,i don't think they saw us.
ross,(apparently unruffled) oh. can i... can i ask who?
ross,"i think i know too but i've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so..."
ross,i'm sorry... we... we can't.
ross,"i mean, you just went out with my best friend, and i just think it'd be a really really bad idea. (pause) or-or not! (they kiss passionately)"
rachel,what?
