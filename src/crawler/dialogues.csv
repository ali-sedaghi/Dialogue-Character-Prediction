ross,"Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here."
monica,Do you really want a job with
chandler,"Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for."
rachel,"Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...'"
ross,"Rach, did you proofread these?"
rachel,"Uh... yeah, why?"
ross,"Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent"
rachel,"[upset] Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?"
joey,"Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few."
monica,"Hey, guys."
rachel,"Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? [to Monica, quietly]: Did you bring the mail?"
monica,Lots of responses.
rachel,"[to Monica]: Really? [out loud]: Sure, we have scones left! [to Monica]: OK, read them to me."
phoebe,"[reading]: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh... [crumples up letter]"
rachel,[out loud]: We have apple cinnamon...
monica,[reading]: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No. [crumpes up letter]
phoebe,Wow!
rachel,What?
phoebe,[reading]: Your Visa bill is huge!
rachel,[grabs the bill] Give me that!
chandler,"You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?"
joey,"I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you."
ross,I don't know.
chandler,Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
ross,"No, it's not just that. It's just--I want someone who... who"
chandler,...little playthings with yarn?
ross,What?
chandler,Could you want her more?
ross,Who?
chandler,"[sarcastically] Dee, the sarcastic sister from"
ross,"Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... [Rachel comes over, Ross lays head on table]: Hiiii!"
rachel,Hi! How are you?
ross,"We're fine, we're fine."
rachel,OK. [walks away]
joey,Shut up!
ross,And here's little Ben nodding off...
ross,[quietly] That would be nice.
joey,"Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back."
joey,"I will, really. I'll pay you back this time."
ross,She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
chandler,Any contact?
ross,She lent me an egg once.
joey,You're in!
ross,"Aw, right."
ross,Hey. [stutters something incoherent]
chandler,"Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian--I don't think we need a third..."
joey,"Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks."
chandler,We're not--we're not saying anything.
phoebe,What?
ross,Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
joey,Thank you.
chandler,"[to the girls] We were playing poker, alright..."
joey,"There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?"
ross,"Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'"
chandler,And then he did.
joey,Well... I'm helping out down at the NYU Med School with some... research.
ross,[overhearing] What kind of research?
joey,"Oh, just, y'know.... science."
ross,"Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. [everyone's interest is piqued, they all look over]"
joey,[sigh]... It's a fertility study.
joey,"Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars."
ross,Hey.
joey,We make fire. Cook meat.
joey,"Oh, OK."
joey,"I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great."
joey,"What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?"
joey,"Well, the tough thing is, she"
joey,"Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean."
ross,Hey. [Phoebe sees his bags]
ross,I'm going to China.
ross,"Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo--it's--it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary [hands a sheet of paper to Monica]. Um... here's a picture of me... [hands it to Monica]"
ross,"[to Monica]: Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?"
ross,"Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left."
ross,"Oh. [pause] Hey, who's Carl?"
ross,No.
ross,"At the coffeehouse, right."
ross,"OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys."
ross,Hi.
joey,Hey!
ross,An egg?
joey,"Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, ""Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."""
chandler,I think it's winning.
ross,I think it's insane.
chandler,"She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend."
joey,Think it'll work?
chandler,"No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg."
monica,You can not do this.
rachel,"Do what, do what?"
monica,Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
rachel,No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
phoebe,"'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
monica,"But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do."
rachel,"Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
joey,"Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
chandler,"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
joey,"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend."
chandler,"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a--"
joey,"Pathetic mess? I know, but--come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! [Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and eats it.] Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this."
ross,Hi. She said yes.
chandler,"Yes! Way to go, man! [Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.] Still got the egg, huh?"
joey,[Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife] How do I look?
chandler,"Oh, uh, I... don't... care. [Joey's date shows up] Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess."
chandler,...And what did you bring?
chandler,Janice?
chandler,"[angrily] Hey, it's Janice."
chandler,"Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window."
joey,"No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down. CHANDLER: Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!"
joey,"[at the urinal] Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous."
chandler,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. [gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear] Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!"
ross,She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
ross,"I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug."
joey,Do we have to know about that?
joey,"I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars."
ross,"God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab."
ross,She's not even here yet.
ross,[to Carol] Where the hell have you been?
ross,"Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys."
ross,Stopped for a Chunky.
ross,[weakly] No.
ross,"Dr. Franzblau, hi."
ross,"59 seconds. [holds up his watch] Quartz, ha."
ross,I'll get it.
ross,I got it--I'm getting it!
joey,"[to the screen] Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too."
joey,"Oh, yeah."
rachel,"Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?"
phoebe,"Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?"
ross,"No, women are welcome to play."
phoebe,"Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?"
ross,[sigh]....I have to go to China.
joey,The country?
ross,"No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?"
ross,"Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight."
joey,Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
joey,"He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food."
ross,"Yeah... I guess. I don't--I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? [gives Chandler a gift for Rachel]"
joey,"Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you."
ross,I know.
joey,"We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. [Joey gives Ross a hug]"
joey,"Like the three musketeers, only with fruit."
joey,"Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I--"
joey,"Then you do. Heh, heh."
joey,What do you mean?
joey,Not following you.
joey,[to Rachel]: That book got me through some tough times.
joey,"[pats Chandler on the leg] That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time."
joey,"Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something."
joey,The country.
joey,"He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait."
ross,[something in Chinese]
ross,Ni-chou chi-ma! [walks onto jetway]
joey,"Heh, heh. It was nothin'."
joey,"[panicked] Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn."
joey,Sure! Why not?
joey,How do you mean?
joey,Shhhh!
joey,She's still asleep.
joey,"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?"
joey,"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!"
joey,"It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level."
joey,I know! Neither did I!
rachel,"Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney."
monica,Which one was Pete Carney?
rachel,"Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. [imitating] ""Was it good for you?"""
monica,"Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-""I-win""-guy. [imitating] ""I win! I win!"" I went out with the guy for two months--I didn't get to win once."
rachel,How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
monica,I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
phoebe,I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
monica,"There's more beer, right?"
phoebe,"Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual."
rachel,"Phoebes, this woman is voluntarily bald."
phoebe,"Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect."
monica,"Ok, well, what kind of ritual?"
phoebe,"Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us."
rachel,Or?
phoebe,"Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks."
monica,Burning's good.
rachel,"Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn."
joey,"Good for you. [jumps suddenly] Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?"
chandler,That's OK.
joey,[to Lorraine] We can't do that.
chandler,[disgusted] What? What can't you do?
joey,"Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?"
joey,"Uh, we might be leaving now."
chandler,"Tell me it's ""you and me"" we."
joey,"She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it."
chandler,"Ok, you can not do this to me."
joey,"You're right, I'm sorry. You're right."
joey,"I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler."
chandler,I hope she throws up on you.
chandler,So...
joey,"Hey, listen, lady....[sees that she's pregnant]...whoa."
joey,Oh yeah? And who do you like?
joey,"The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?"
joey,"Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!"
joey,"Oh, oh, oh, sorry."
ross,Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
joey,Tribbiani.
joey,"[takes phone] Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. [pause] Yeah, I'm single. [pause] 25. An actor. [pause] Hello?"
joey,"Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?"
joey,"Ok, look, maybe I should just go."
joey,"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?"
joey,You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
joey,"Oh, it is."
joey,It is.
ross,Breathe.
ross,Breathe.
ross,Breathe.
ross,"15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12..."
ross,Who the hell is Jordie?
ross,"No no no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie."
ross,"What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,"
ross,I got it.
ross,"I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps."
ross,Why?
ross,"No, you started it."
ross,But--
ross,[to Susan] Thanks a lot.
ross,"[to Carol] Yeah, listen--"
joey,Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
chandler,There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
joey,"Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker."
monica,"Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!"
rachel,Really.
monica,"I mean, that's a typical guy response."
ross,"Excuse me, do any of"
rachel,But you could teach us.
chandler,"[teaching] OK, so now we draw cards."
monica,"So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight."
rachel,"Oh, good for you!"
phoebe,Congratulations!
joey,Seven hundred bucks!
joey,"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something."
joey,"What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? [Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.]"
ross,I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
ross,"Fine, just stop thinking about me."
ross,"Can't do it, can you?"
ross,"I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?"
ross,"Rachel, come on. Give us a chance."
ross,"No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade."
ross,I know.
ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?"
ross,[pause] No. But... it only has to happen
ross,"Well, start looking."
ross,"Oh, hey, hey, I got that."
ross,No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
ross,Yeah.
ross,"No, no, they will. I just... uh..."
ross,"Come on, they're gonna love you."
chandler,"Oh, what a crappy night!"
chandler,"Excuse me. [gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him] How ya doin'?"
chandler,Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
chandler,"You got it. Good woman! [the waiter turns around, it's a man] Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?"
chandler,"That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. [to Janice] I've always wanted to know..."
chandler,"No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice."
monica,"Oh, Chandler, sorry."
joey,"[panicked] Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?"
ross,Please. This is so your fault.
ross,"Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along."
ross,You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
ross,"Oh, I'm threatened by you?"
ross,"Yeah, Susan."
ross,"I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. [walks backwards as if he is going to break down the door, but steps in a bucket and falls] Ow."
joey,"Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's-- [notices the nurse looking at him strangely] I was just--yeah, right. Push! Push!"
ross,Help! Help!
joey,"Oh, just had a baby."
ross,"Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. [to Susan] This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
ross,"No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?"
ross,You wanna explain that?
ross,"Ok, got the vent open."
ross,"Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben."
ross,"Phoebs, It's open! It's open!"
ross,We're here!
ross,"Long story, honey."
ross,"[puts his head near the baby] Hello! [to Dr. Franzblau] Oh, sorry."
ross,"We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person."
ross,"Oh, thanks, Pheebs!"
ross,[thinking] How 'bout Ben?
ross,"We uh, we just cooked it up."
ross,Hey.
ross,"[to Ben] I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody."
chandler,"OK Phoebs, how many do you want?"
phoebe,"OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs."
ross,"No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't--you can't do--"
rachel,"Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! [gives it to Phoebe] Ross: No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that."
rachel,"Oh, no no no no no no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours."
ross,"Oh, you're... [gives up]"
monica,"Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites."
joey,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz--[look of realization]"
chandler,"[changing subject] OK, so at this point, the dealer--"
monica,"Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks..."
ross,"Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy..."
phoebe,"But... I'm ready, so, just deal."
chandler,"OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. [holds up two cards] Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. [Joey is unamused] Alright babe, deal the cards."
monica,"[throws down her cards] Dammit, dammit, dammit!"
phoebe,"[to Joey]: Oh I see, so then, you were lying."
joey,About what?
phoebe,About how good your cards were.
joey,Heh... I was
phoebe,A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
rachel,"OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... [gets up to leave]"
chandler,"Rach, Rach, we gotta settle."
rachel,Settle what?
chandler,"The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so..."
ross,"The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game."
rachel,Oh. Right.
joey,"You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?"
monica,"Hell no, we'll pay!"
phoebe,"OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready."
monica,And you know what? We want a rematch.
ross,Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
rachel,"[to Ross]: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends."
ross,[pause]...Yeah.
chandler,"Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less."
ross,"Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... [claps hands three times]"
joey,[pause]...Yeah?
ross,I'm
ross,"Alright boys, let's eat."
chandler,"Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?"
ross,You still on that?
chandler,"Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? [mimicking]: When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
ross,"You are way off, pal."
joey,"No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her."
ross,"Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time--not any more. I just--I--"
ross,Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
monica,"Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice."
chandler,"Ok, well, this was very special."
monica,"Rache, come see who's out here!"
rachel,"Oh my god. Janice, hi!"
chandler,Janice is gonna go away now.
monica,I'll be right back.
rachel,"Oh, Joey, look who it is."
joey,[in disbelief] Whoa.
chandler,"Oh, good, Joey's home now."
monica,"Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. [to Chandler] He just happened to call."
ross,"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half."
ross,"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend."
ross,If you wanna put a label on it.
ross,"Nope, nope, that's it."
ross,"Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. [to Carol and Susan] Helloo!"
phoebe,"Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine."
monica,"All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca."
phoebe,"Um, that's ok! [throws it in fire] Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man."
rachel,"Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place."
ross,"The head, the head. You gotta..."
joey,"Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name."
joey,"He doesn't do much, does he?"
ross,"No, this is pretty much it."
ross,"All right, I'll see you guys later."
ross,"You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK--if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble."
rachel,[opening mail] Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
monica,"Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive."
phoebe,"Ha. Ha, ha."
monica,What?
phoebe,"Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black."
monica,Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
rachel,"Oh, I beg to differ. The"
monica,That was
rachel,Oooooh. [reads letter] [surprised]: Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
monica,You're kidding! Where? Where?
rachel,[in disbelief]: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
monica,"Oh, Rachel!"
phoebe,"Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home."
monica,"Well, what's the job?"
rachel,Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
monica,"OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. [opens door] Hi!"
rachel,No.
monica,I don't think so.
rachel,Why?
monica,What?
rachel,Oh my God!
monica,Really?
phoebe,Thank y-- [thinks about it]
monica,"Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel..."
phoebe,"Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?"
ross,Alright.
ross,I'm gonna pay for
rachel,Hi!
ross,Hey.
rachel,"Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!"
chandler,"Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?"
monica,Can we just start throwing things in?
phoebe,"Ok, yeah, ok. [she throws the directions in] Oh, OK."
rachel,"[tossing things in the fire] Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts."
phoebe,"Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah."
monica,"Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked."
rachel,[looking at picture] Hey he's wearing a sweater.
monica,No.
rachel,And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
monica,"Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure--"
chandler,How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
joey,I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
chandler,"Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush."
chandler,"Hi, Just Janice."
joey,"[to Chandler] If you don't do it, I will."
ross,"So, um, what do you do for a living?"
ross,"Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad."
ross,Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
ross,"Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...[struggling]...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!"
monica,"You know, it's a really funny story how this happened."
rachel,Really?
chandler,"Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. [reading the candy] Chan and Jan Forever."
chandler,"Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no"
chandler,[surprised] It is?
rachel,"Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and--oh, I went to camp with her cousin... and, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!"
rachel,"Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story--"
monica,"OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker."
joey,"Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand."
chandler,"Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know..."
monica,"Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?"
ross,"Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?"
rachel,"No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go."
ross,Alright.
chandler,"Oh no, you see, actually it is."
chandler,"Oh, no I don't."
chandler,"I did, but--"
chandler,Call me!
ross,"You did so. I swear, I swear--[noticing Kristin's absence] How long has she been in the bathroom?"
ross,Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
ross,"Oh, god. [He puts his head down on the grill] You know, this is still pretty hot. [He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off and eats it.]"
ross,"No, it's just...you know the whole ""getting on with your life"" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you."
ross,"No but, no but."
ross,"That's easy for you to say, you found one already."
rachel,"So, um, will you bring the truck?"
rachel,"Oh, my god."
phoebe,"See, there you go, the cleansing works!"
monica,They're nice guys.
rachel,"Oh, they're firemen guys."
rachel,"Alright... [shuffles cards expertly, all the guys stare in amazement]"
ross,"So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones."
joey,"But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game."
phoebe,"Alright, here's my $7.50. [hands them the money] But I think you should know that this money is cursed."
joey,What?
phoebe,"Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it."
chandler,"That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie."
ross,"Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen..."
rachel,"Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women. [hands over her money]"
monica,"You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves"
rachel,"Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon."
ross,What's going on?
joey,So what're you going to do?
ross,"Ah, the lesser-known ""I don't have a dream"" speech."
ross,"Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?"
joey,"How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free."
ross,"OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?"
ross,Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
ross,"Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I might introduce her to my monkey."
joey,"[aside to Ross] So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... [gestures with hands, back and forth] huh-huh?"
ross,"Well, I don't know.... [gestures] huh-huh.... but I'm hoping [gestures] huh-huh."
joey,"I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal."
ross,"He's not going to hurt you! Keep going, Celia. Marcel..."
ross,Alright... [lifts Marcel away]
joey,[tasting] Mmmm. Good.
joey,It's creamier.
joey,"I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?"
joey,Uh-oh.
ross,"So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing."
rachel,"Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy."
monica,"OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?"
phoebe,"[holding a card and waving it in front of her face] Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. [they look at her] Right, OK, serious poker."
monica,"Excuse me, where are you going?"
ross,Uh... to the bathroom.
monica,"Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?"
ross,I want to go to the bathroom. [exits]
joey,"Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. [gets up]"
rachel,"Oh no no no no no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then."
ross,"OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning..."
ross,"[embarrassed] Wha... what, here?"
ross,Ah....
ross,[panicked] Er.... um.....
ross,Um... uh.... vulva.
joey,[in disbelief]
ross,"Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling."
joey,[sarcastic] Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
ross,"Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?"
joey,What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
ross,[deadpan] Please be kidding.
joey,Why not? Come on! Close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
ross,OK. [closes eyes] I'm in my apartment...
joey,....yeah... what else?
ross,"That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. [gets up, walks across room]"
joey,"[walks to catch up to him] Alright, look, I'll start, OK?"
ross,"Joey, please."
joey,"Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! [in a low voice] Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me"
ross,[impressed] Wow.
joey,"Alright, now you say something."
ross,I... ahem... I really don't think so.
joey,"Come on! You like this woman, right?"
joey,That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
monica,"Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. [deals cards]"
phoebe,[looks at her cards] Yes! [everyone looks at her] .... or no.
ross,"Alright. [to Rachel]: Your money's mine, Green."
rachel,"Your fly is open, Geller. [he checks it, and zips up]"
phoebe,"You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?"
chandler,"Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
joey,Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
phoebe,Yeah. Um... I'm out. [throws in cards]
rachel,I'm in.
monica,Me too.
joey,"Me too. Alright, whattaya got."
ross,"Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. [lays down cards]"
rachel,"Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! [lays down cards] I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? [collects chips] I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. [holds up a chip] I think that one was Ross's, and I think--oh--that one was Ross's. Yes! [starts singing]: Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it..."
rachel,And your fly's still open...
rachel,"Ha, I made you look...."
ross,Yeah.
joey,"You want to see her again, right?"
ross,Sure.
joey,"Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!"
ross,"OK, turn around. [Joey looks taken aback] I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this."
joey,"[turning around] Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead."
ross,"Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips."
joey,There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
ross,"I, er..."
ross,I want to take my tongue... and...
ross,....and....
joey,Say it... say it!
ross,...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
ross,[rushing to explain] Funny story!
joey,"Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again."
joey,"And again, and again, and again... [phone rings, he answers] Hello? [hands phone to Chandler] And again."
joey,What a tool!
ross,"Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef."
chandler,"This is unbelievable. It's been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, you'd be looking like a ham right about now."
joey,"There's the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?"
chandler,It's Phoebe! Hi!
chandler,"Wait, wait! Wh-What are you doing here?"
joey,"No, no how come are you working here?"
chandler,Can we start over?
ross,"I don't know whether he's testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, supposedly by accident."
rachel,I couldn't be inner. Monica?
phoebe,"Monica, in or out?"
monica,[slams down cards] I hate this game!
phoebe,"OK Joey, your bet."
joey,"Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. [the girls look at him, confused] Oh, I'm out."
phoebe,Ross?
ross,"Oh, I am very in."
phoebe,Chandler?
chandler,Couldn't be more out. [throws in cards]
phoebe,Me too. Rachel.
rachel,"Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. [throws chips in pot] What do you say... want to waste another buck?"
ross,"No, not this time. [he folds] So... what'd you have?"
rachel,I'm not telling. [collects chips]
ross,"Come on, show them to me. [reaches for her cards, Rachel covers them up]"
rachel,No..!
ross,Show them to me!
rachel,Get your hands out of there! No!
ross,Let me see! Show them!
chandler,"Y'know, I've had dates like this."
rachel,"[deals new hand] Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple..."
phoebe,Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
ross,"First of all, I'm not losing..."
rachel,"Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. [phone rings]"
ross,Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the--
joey,"[to Ross] So, er... how did it go with Celia?"
ross,"Oh, I was unbelievable."
joey,"All right, Ross!"
ross,I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have
joey,Whoa! And the... [gestures with hands] huh-huh?
ross,"Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so..."
joey,You cuddled.
ross,"Yeah, which was nice."
joey,"Yeah, where the hell is he?"
rachel,Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
monica,"Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or ankle or something."
rachel,Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
monica,"All right. Name, address...Ok, in case of emergency call?"
rachel,You.
monica,Really?
rachel,Yeah.
monica,"Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh. I love you. Insurance?"
rachel,"Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that. Monica: You don't have insurance?"
rachel,"Oh, yeah, I've done that."
ross,"And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did and pee-ed all over the crossword."
rachel,I've never done that.
chandler,"All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn't look exactly like her sister."
joey,I'm sayin' I see a difference.
chandler,They're twins!
joey,I don't care. Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's--hot!
chandler,"You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things. Let's not do that anymore."
joey,"Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today."
phoebe,"Ooh! Oh! Fun! Ok. Um, Liam Neeson."
joey,Nope.
phoebe,Morly Safer.
joey,Nope.
phoebe,The woman who cuts my hair!
monica,"Ok, look, this could be a really long game."
chandler,Your sister Ursula.
phoebe,"Oh, really."
chandler,"Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh--"
phoebe,"Riff's. Yeah, I know."
chandler,"Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven't talked in like years."
phoebe,"Hmmm? Uh, yeah. So, uh, is she fat?"
joey,Not from where I was standin'.
phoebe,Where were you standing?
rachel,"Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don't get along?"
phoebe,"It's mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know. Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it, later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like ""yeah, right, well what else is new""?"
ross,"Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, but I've got to go. I've got Lamaze class."
chandler,"Oh, and I've got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in gym."
rachel,"So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?"
ross,"No, Susan's gonna be there too. We've got dads, we've got lesbians, the whole parenting team."
rachel,"[answering phone] Hel-lo, Rachel Green."
ross,"[mimicking Rachel] Mee mee, mee-mee mee."
rachel,[on phone]: Excuse me. [covers up phone; to Ross]: It's about the
rachel,"Barbara! Hi, how are you? [pause] Uh-huh. [pause] No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, plea--Hello? Hello? [hangs up phone, very depressed]"
monica,"Sorry, Rach."
phoebe,"Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff."
rachel,"Yeah...[sigh]....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante."
joey,"Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this."
rachel,"Yes, we do. [pause]"
monica,"Alright, check."
rachel,"Why, how much is this gonna cost?"
monica,"I have no idea, but x-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars."
rachel,Well what are we gonna do?
monica,There's not much we can do.
rachel,"Um, unless, unless I use yours."
monica,No no no no no no no no no.
rachel,"Well, now, wait a second. Who did I just put as my ""In case of emergency"" call person?"
monica,That's insurance fraud.
rachel,"Well, all right, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow!"
monica,Ok. Ok. I hate this.
rachel,Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
monica,"Hi. Um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms."
monica,"I am really an idiot. You see, I was filling out my friend's forms, and instead of putting her information, I put mine."
monica,"Yep, that's me. I am that stupid."
ross,I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
ross,"No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby. I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defense is comin' right at me."
joey,Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
ross,"Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, I just heave it downfield."
chandler,What are you crazy? That's a baby!
joey,He should take the sack?
ross,"Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield, and I realize that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See, I am so not ready to be a father."
chandler,"Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad."
rachel,"Well, isn't that gonna be weird?"
ross,"No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation."
monica,"Ross, that's my jacket."
ross,I know.
ross,"I'm Ross Geller, and that's, that's my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this is Susan Bunch. Susan is Carol's... Who's next?"
ross,Susan is Carol's Carol's Carol's friend.
ross,Like buddies.
ross,You know how close women can get.
ross,Although I was married to her.
ross,Right.
ross,A little.
ross,"Absolutely. So, twins. Huh, that's like two births. Ouch."
chandler,"And (buzzing noise) to you too, Helen."
chandler,"Oh, ok. Send her in."
chandler,"Hi, Nina. Come on in."
chandler,"Uh, Yes. Yes. I've just been going over your data here, and little thing, you've been post-dating your Friday numbers."
chandler,"Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack."
chandler,WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net Usage Statistics.
chandler,"It's not just that she's cute, ok. It's just that she's really really cute."
ross,It doesn't matter. You don't dip your pen in the company ink.
monica,"Ross, your little creature's got the remote again."
ross,"Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote..."
joey,Check.
ross,I'm in for fifty cents. [throws it in]
chandler,Call.
phoebe,I'm in.
rachel,I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. [throws it in]
ross,"I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit."
rachel,"Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?"
rachel,[to Ross]: Loser?
ross,"Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?"
joey,"Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me."
ross,Multiple orgasms!
joey,"No plans, huh?"
ross,"Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?"
joey,"Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling."
ross,Tony?
ross,"Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. [Rachel gives him a dirty look] Nothing, just, just, I'm fine."
ross,"That guy, he burns me up."
joey,"My god, Angela."
joey,"No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. [he walks over to her] Hey, Angela."
joey,"Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking. Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?"
chandler,"Well, only if you order stuff."
joey,I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
ross,Whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
joey,When's that?
ross,Tonight.
joey,"Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?"
ross,You take your time.
chandler,There it is! So what're you gonna do?
joey,"What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula."
chandler,And your friend Phoebe?
joey,"Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?"
chandler,"Man if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit."
monica,"Yes, yes she is."
rachel,"Hi, this is my friend Rachel."
monica,Hi.
rachel,Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
rachel,"I meant young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh, Good Rach."
monica,Thank you.
rachel,Right.
rachel,"So, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it."
monica,"Uh, you left out the stupid part."
rachel,"Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said yes."
monica,"I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. I say we blow off the dates."
rachel,"What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!"
chandler,"All right, what have we learned so far?"
ross,What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
rachel,Was that the cake?
ross,"Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon shmush."
monica,"Come on, she'll be here any minute."
monica,Great.
ross,"Relax, I'll fix it."
rachel,"Oh, cool. ""Urkel"" in Spanish is ""Urkel""."
ross,How did he do this?
chandler,"So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?"
monica,"No, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year's but obviously someone forgot."
rachel,"Well someone was supposed to write ""Rache, take down the lights"" and put it on the refrigerator. How long has that been there?"
chandler,"Hey, where you been?"
joey,"I went back to Riff's. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, and she brought me a tuna melt and four plates of curly fries."
chandler,Score.
joey,She is so hot.
chandler,"Yeah, listen. Before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by, uh--"
joey,Pheebs? You think it would be ok if I asked out your sister?
phoebe,Why? Why would you wanna do that? Why?
joey,"So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there."
phoebe,"Well, I mean, I'm not my sister's, you know, whatever, and uh, I mean, it's true, we were one egg, once, but you know, we've grown apart. So, uh, I don't know. Why not?"
joey,"Cool, thanks."
ross,You ok?
phoebe,Yeah I'm fine.
ross,You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
ross,Sorry. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Where's Carol?
ross,"No, no, no. I think I should stay. I think we should both know what's going on."
ross,"No, I fold. [lays cards down, and gets up]"
rachel,"What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?"
ross,I'm in. [throws in chips]
rachel,How many you want?
ross,One. [Rachel gives him the card.]
rachel,Dealer takes two. [she deals herself two cards] What do you bet?
ross,I bet two dollars. [throws it in]
rachel,OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. [throws it in]
ross,"I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. [throws it in]"
rachel,"See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse."
monica,"Rachel, there's nothing in it."
rachel,"OK, then get me your purse."
monica,"OK, here you go. Good luck."
rachel,"[to Monica]: Thank you. [to Ross]: I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven."
phoebe,...teen! [throws in a ten-dollar bill]
ross,"[to Joey]: Joey, I'm a little shy."
joey,"That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?"
chandler,"[to Ross]: What do you need, what do you need?"
ross,Fifteen.
chandler,"Alright, here's ten. [gives it to him]"
joey,You look good.
joey,You don't say.
ross,"So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?"
ross,"Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?"
ross,"Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?"
ross,"Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?"
joey,Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
joey,"Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too."
joey,What?
joey,"Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?"
joey,"You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica."
joey,"Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you."
joey,"Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is--"
joey,What?
joey,"Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me."
joey,"[proud] I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?"
ross,"[on phone] Ok, bye. [hangs up] Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel."
ross,It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
ross,Nuh-uh.
ross,"So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?"
ross,[sheepish] No.
ross,"Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way."
rachel,I hope it's ok.
chandler,Happy birthday Peehee.
monica,"Well maybe we can make a ""b"" out of one of those roses."
ross,"Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools."
phoebe,"Hey, what's going on?"
phoebe,"Oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room. Where's Joey?"
chandler,Did you see Betty?
ross,"Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?"
ross,"Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of panicky, ""Oh my god I'm gonna be a father"" kind of a thing?"
ross,"No, no, Dad, I was just wondering."
ross,"Thanks, Dad. Really, you know, I just, I just needed to know, when did you start to feel like a father?"
ross,"No, we can go to Williamsburg."
monica,"Rachel, the cute doctors are here."
rachel,"Ok, coming!"
monica,"Hi, come on in."
rachel,"Oh, that's great. Look at that."
monica,"It's uh, well, uh, why don't you tell them? After all, it is your ankle."
rachel,"You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you. Well, listen, why don't you two sit down, and we'll get you some glasses....STAT."
rachel,"Ok, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are. I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine, I really do."
monica,It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
rachel,Would you stop being such a wuss?
monica,"A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, ok?"
ross,What? What?
ross,"Ok, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time."
ross,I see. So what do you propose to do?
ross,"Flip me for it? No, no, no--heads, heads!"
chandler,"Mr. D, how's it going, sir??"
chandler,And?
chandler,So what does this mean?
chandler,"Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very--"
chandler,Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
chandler,"Yes, yes I am. Listen, the reason that I called you in here today is, uh, please don't hate me."
chandler,Would you like to have dinner sometime?
rachel,"So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?"
phoebe,"Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me."
rachel,Ok. Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn?
phoebe,Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
phoebe,Yeah?
phoebe,"Right, and it's me."
phoebe,Much as you are.
phoebe,"Oh, that's good."
phoebe,Good choice.
monica,I can't believe you. You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job yet?
chandler,"Well, you still haven't taken down the Christmas lights."
monica,"Congratulations, I think you've found the world's thinnest argument."
chandler,"I'm just trying to find the right moment, you know?"
rachel,"Oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating. Sweetheart, you're fired, but how 'bout a quickie before I go to work."
joey,"Here, I got five, I got five. [Ross takes the money]"
ross,Thank you.
chandler,Good luck.
ross,"[to Rachel]: OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?"
rachel,[lays down cards] Full house.
ross,You got me.
joey,"[to Ross]: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat."
chandler,[to Ross]: I thought we had them!
ross,"Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. [looks at Rachel] But, uh... look how happy she is. [smiles]"
chandler,Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
rachel,"Oh, time's up."
monica,"[pointing at the drawing, upset] Bye... bye..."
joey,Oh!
phoebe,
phoebe,That's a
joey,Yep.
joey,Which what?
joey,"No, but he's--"
ross,What's goin' on?
ross,Was your basket on top?
ross,So?
ross,"No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. [to woman] That's my friend's machine."
ross,"Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it."
ross,"[to the crowd in the laundromat] All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. [to Rachel] Ok, let's do laundry."
ross,"Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent."
ross,
ross,"Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?"
ross,"Rach, have you never done this before?"
ross,"Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things."
ross,"[visibly nervous] Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call."
joey,Oh my god.
joey,I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
joey,"So, you and Angela, huh?"
joey,"You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."
joey,"Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it."
joey,"Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually."
ross,"That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? [the buzzer on the washer goes off] I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...[opens up the washer] Uh-oh."
ross,"[not wanting to tell her] Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. [singing] Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh."
ross,"Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done."
ross,"All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink."
ross,"Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone."
monica,"I said we are not going to do it. Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby."
rachel,I am not a baby. You know what?
monica,What?
rachel,You know what?
monica,What?
rachel,"Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother."
rachel,"I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago."
monica,"Yeah, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar. Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?"
rachel,"Uh, I'm a uh, chef at a restaurant uptown."
rachel,"Yeah it is. Mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do."
monica,"(laughing) Oh, God, I am so spoiled. That's it."
rachel,"And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow."
monica,I used to wet my bed.
rachel,I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
monica,We both do that.
monica,"Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um, there's something that I've been meaning to tell you. Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Drestin and I had sex on your bed."
rachel,"Daddy, daddy, why? Why would I sleep with Billy Drestin? His father tried to put you out of business! You are dead!"
monica,"Ross, he's got the remote again."
ross,Good. Maybe he can switch it back. Maybe not.
rachel,"Hello? Uh, yeah, uh, hold on a second. Let me see if she's here. It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. Oh, god, what do we do, what do we do?"
monica,Find out what they want.
rachel,"No, you do it."
monica,"Hello, this is Monica. Yeah? Oh, ok, yes, we'll be right down. Thank you."
rachel,What?
monica,We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
rachel,"You were right, this was just not worth it."
monica,Thank you.
rachel,"Ok, let me just change."
joey,Hey.
ross,Hey.
phoebe,Hi. Trouble?
joey,Your sister stood me up the other night.
phoebe,"Oh, no. Don't you just hate it when people aren't there for you?"
ross,Well did you try calling her?
joey,"I've been trying for two days. When I call the restaurant, they say she's too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off."
phoebe,Hey.
phoebe,"Um, you, got a minute?"
phoebe,So.
phoebe,"Um, oh, I got you a birthday present."
phoebe,"Right, like the kind you--"
phoebe,How'd you know I was coming?
phoebe,I can't believe you did this. I can't believe you--did this.
phoebe,Does he know?
phoebe,"Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you."
phoebe,You got me.
phoebe,"So, um, are you gonna call him?"
phoebe,No. Joey.
phoebe,No. No food with a face.
joey,Hey.
chandler,"You know, once you're inside, you don't have to knock anymore."
monica,"I'll get it. Hi, Mr. Heckles."
monica,"We're not doing anything. We're just sitting around talking, quietly."
rachel,You don't even have cats.
monica,Goodbye Mr. Heckles.
rachel,We'll try to keep it down.
joey,"Phoebe, could you do me a favor? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits."
phoebe,"Oh, my first birthday present. Oh, this is really--"
joey,"Oh, no no no. It's for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size wise."
phoebe,"Oh, sure, yeah. Ok, it fits."
rachel,Are you seein' her again tonight?
joey,Yep. Ice Capades.
chandler,"Wow, this is serious. I've never known you to pay money for any kind of capade."
joey,"I don't know. I like her, you know. She's different. There's uh, somethin about her that--"
phoebe,That you like. We get it. You like her. Great.
joey,"Hey, Phoebe, I asked you and you said it was ok."
phoebe,"All right, well, maybe now it's not ok."
joey,"Ok, well maybe now I'm not ok with it not being ok."
phoebe,Ok.
chandler,"Knit, good woman, knit, knit!"
chandler,And that's the Chrysler building right there.
chandler,"Yes, yes she is. Didn't I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, uh, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Fl---, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan, and uh, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly. In fact, he uh, mentioned the word ""frenzy""."
chandler,"Oh, no, no. Nina--she is whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all."
chandler,"And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself or others."
chandler,"Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir."
ross,"Susan, go deep."
ross,"Carol, honey, shhh, everything's gonna be all right."
ross,That commercial always makes me so sad.
joey,"Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK."
ross,I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
phoebe,"I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin."
monica,And the fact that they're both monkeys.
ross,"Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away."
rachel,"Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding."
ross,"Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it."
chandler,"Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem."
rachel,"OK, OK, it's my turn. [reads the answer]"
chandler,Go.
ross,Uh.... bean! Bean!
joey,[triumphantly] The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
rachel,Yes!
monica,
joey,What?
joey,"Come on, they're close."
joey,"Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross."
joey,"Well, who's to say what's true? I mean--"
joey,"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."
joey,Ow!
joey,"Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you."
joey,"Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up."
joey,"Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here."
ross,You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
ross,"You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen."
ross,"Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? [Ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.] I'm fine, I'm fine."
ross,No.
ross,Yeah.
ross,Yeah.
joey,Excellent.
ross,"What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way."
phoebe,"Yeah, you too."
rachel,"Hi, remember us?"
monica,"You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on an admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I, I put the wrong name again. 'Cause um..."
monica,I am. I'm that stupid.
rachel,And I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
rachel,I know. I'm just not that bright either.
chandler,"Ok, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father. Say your son never feels connected to you as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this."
ross,Do you have a point?
chandler,"You know, you'd think I would. What's up with the simian? ROSS: It's just a furball."
chandler,"Ok, who's turn is it?"
ross,"Yours. I just got 43 points for ""kidney""."
chandler,"No, no, you got zero points for ""idney""."
ross,"I had a ""k"". Where's my ""k""?"
ross,"You've got to help me! My monkey swallowed a ""k""!"
ross,"No, you don't understand. The animal hospital is way across town. He's choking. I don't know what else to do."
monica,What's goin' on?
chandler,Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
ross,"Lady, he is people. He has a name, ok? He watches Jeopardy. He touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please, have a heart!"
monica,Michael.
rachel,What?
monica,Monica.
rachel,Oh.
monica,Hi.
rachel,Hi.
phoebe,Hey.
joey,"Urs, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you."
phoebe,"Listen, um."
joey,"No, no, no, don't say ""listen"". I know that ""listen"". I've said that ""listen""."
ross,"Man, I sure miss Julie."
chandler,"Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there."
ross,You ever figure out what that thing's for?
chandler,"No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned."
chandler,What?
chandler,Bob here.
chandler,(on phone) What've you been up to?
chandler,Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. (to Ross) I love her.
ross,I know.
chandler,I'm back.
chandler,"Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?"
chandler,Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
ross,"Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, ""hey, you're not Bob."""
chandler,"I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table."
ross,Oh my god. You are pure evil.
chandler,"Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this."
ross,"Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me."
rachel,"Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . ."
ross,C'mon Rachel.
rachel,"OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair."
ross,"See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said."
rachel,"Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. [she walks off and Ross puts his hand to his hair]"
phoebe,"Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information. [hangs up]"
phoebe,"Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name."
phoebe,"Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math."
phoebe,"No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know."
phoebe,Whattaya mean?
ross,I'm gonna be a father.
rachel,It's just occurring to you?
ross,"I always knew I was havin' a baby, I just never realized the baby was having me."
rachel,"Oh, you're gonna be great!"
ross,"Aw, how can you say that? I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?"
chandler,"You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different."
phoebe,Where're you going?
joey,Out.
phoebe,With?
joey,Yes.
phoebe,"All right, could I just ask you one question? Have you two, you know...like, you know, you know, yet?"
joey,"Well, not that it's any of your business, but, no, we haven't, ok? You meant sex, right?"
chandler,"Uh, sure, Nina. What's up?"
chandler,"Oh, well, uh, maybe that's because they're uh, jealous of us."
chandler,"Uh, well, maybe that's, uh, because you're getting a big raise."
chandler,"Sure, why not?"
chandler,"Oh, you don't know. Helen, would you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise?"
chandler,Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
phoebe,I'm sorry.
joey,I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
phoebe,"Yeah, um, you know, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk."
joey,You don't drink
joey,Urs--
phoebe,"Ok, yeah, so it's not gonna work."
joey,Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
phoebe,"If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?"
joey,"No. No, I, I couldn't do that."
phoebe,"Um, then yes, 'cause of Phoebe. So, you know, it's either her or me."
joey,"Then, uh, then I'm sorry."
phoebe,"You know, you're gonna be really, really hard to get over."
joey,"I know. I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or what, but you have never looked so beautiful."
phoebe,Really?
joey,Pheebs?
phoebe,Yeah.
ross,He looks so tiny.
joey,We just got the message.
phoebe,Is he all right?
ross,"Yeah. The doctor got the ""k"" out. He also found an ""m"" and an ""o""."
chandler,"We think he was trying to spell out ""monkey""."
ross,"Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine. He's just sleeping now."
chandler,"So, you feel like a dad yet?"
ross,"No, why?"
ross,"(on phone) Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico."
rachel,"(sarcastically) Hi, Julie."
chandler,"Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday."
phoebe,"Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?"
chandler,"Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake."
joey,Do we need a cake?
chandler,"Look guys, I know it's a little steep."
rachel,"Yeah, whoosh!"
chandler,But it's Ross.
phoebe,It's Ross.
joey,All right.
chandler,"I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing."
ross,"Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?"
chandler,"You know, I think I might just."
rachel,"So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?"
joey,"Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies."
phoebe,Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
rachel,"Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?"
joey,"Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying ""let's go here, let's go there"". Like we can afford to go here and there."
phoebe,"Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross."
joey,For Ross.
rachel,"For Ross, Ross, Ross."
monica,(enters) Oh my god.
rachel,Hey.
joey,Hi.
rachel,What?
monica,"I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job."
phoebe,Wow. Thank you.
phoebe,"Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! [blows a kiss to a picture of Einstein]"
ross,"Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything."
monica,"No, I will not cave."
rachel,"Yeah, I'm with Mon."
ross,"Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. [approaches Mr. Treeger] Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas."
ross,"No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?"
monica,Ross.
ross,Yeah.
monica,[to Ross] Looks like he's playin' baseball.
ross,You mean hardball?
monica,Whatever.
rachel,What'cha gonna' do?
ross,"Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?"
monica,"So, wait, you really did like my cookies?"
rachel,Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
rachel,"Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil."
rachel,"Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil."
phoebe,OK.
joey,How far'd ya get?
phoebe,Mailbox.
chandler,"Alright, we're gettin' closer."
phoebe,Uh-huh.
joey,"Phoebs, what's goin' on?"
phoebe,"No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . ."
joey,"Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy."
phoebe,"Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter."
chandler,"Well, so why not go knock?"
chandler,"Well, I ended up telling her everything."
rachel,"Oh, how'd she take it?"
chandler,"Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: If you're ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand on the desk."
monica,"Ok, I think I get how to do this."
phoebe,"All right, so, can we turn this off? Just, just make it--make them go away? I can't, I can't look."
monica,"Ok, Pheebs, they're gone. Are you all right?"
phoebe,"Yeah. Yeah. It's just, you know, it's this whole stupid Ursula thing."
rachel,"Ok, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he's going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?"
phoebe,"Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I'm not saying she's like evil or anything. She just, you know, she's always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. Oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like, have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?"
phoebe,"Well, but that's what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then broke his heart, and then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore. Because he said he didn't wanna be around anything that looked like either one of us. I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but--"
chandler,You're not gonna lose him.
monica,"Come on, you gotta talk to Joey."
phoebe,Yeah.
ross,"Come on, he doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt--"
phoebe,But he's falling in love with her.
phoebe,"Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like ""forget about her"" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, ""Oh my god."" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?"
rachel,Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Emergency! Excuse me!
ross,Rache!
rachel,"Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?"
ross,"It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?"
rachel,What?
ross,You're bleeding.
rachel,"I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. I wanna hear everything!"
ross,"Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel."
rachel,"These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country."
rachel,"Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok."
monica,"I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross."
phoebe,"Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?"
joey,"Um, this?"
phoebe,Yes.
chandler,"Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad."
joey,"If it's not you, this is a horrible story."
monica,"Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice."
joey,"Yeah, someplace nice. (to Phoebe and Rachel) How much do you think I can get for my kidney?"
ross,I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
chandler,"Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods."
ross,"That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness."
chandler,"We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy."
ross,Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
chandler,All right.
ross,Go.
chandler,Hi.
chandler,"Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something."
chandler,Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
chandler,"I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?"
chandler,"No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today."
ross,"Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--"
monica,Who is also in charge of purchasing.
ross,Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
monica,Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
ross,"Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--"
phoebe,"Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one."
joey,"Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today."
phoebe,Yeah?
chandler,"Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges."
joey,"Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you."
phoebe,You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
chandler,"Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out."
joey,"Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas."
chandler,"Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!"
joey,"Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?"
monica,"Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier."
ross,"Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go."
phoebe,"Oh, I couldn't go in."
monica,"Honey, I'm sorry."
ross,Are you OK?
phoebe,"Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now."
chandler,"Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. [Ross and Phoebe hug, Monica and Rachel hug, Chandler is left standing]"
joey,"Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright."
joey,They're ribbed for your pleasure.
rachel,"Please, they've been going out a week. They haven't even slept together yet, I mean, that's not serious."
phoebe,"Ok. Oh, ok, oh."
monica,"Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing out here. Would you come back inside?"
monica,"Guys, you got your hair cut."
chandler,"Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay."
phoebe,"'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice."
rachel,"Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp."
chandler,"Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs."
rachel,"You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!"
ross,"That's all right, Rache, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica, Chandler, Joey. Everyone, this is Julie."
ross,And bus.
ross,You gotta hear this story.
rachel,"And the chicken poops in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about."
monica,"This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?"
ross,"But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig."
rachel,"Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
monica,It's just an expression.
ross,"Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby."
ross,"Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time."
chandler,"Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen, 'cause I like to be surprised."
ross,"Hey, Rache, can I get some coffee?"
rachel,"Yeah, sure."
ross,Thank you.
joey,I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.
joey,"Here it is, here it is. [reading from newspaper]"
ross,I don't want to.
ross,Yeah.
joey,Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.
ross,"Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues."
joey,"No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit."
joey,"When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff."
ross,[sullenly] Hiiiiii.
ross,"Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?"
ross,Don't toy with me.
ross,"Hey, Fun Bobby!"
ross,"Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!"
joey,"No, I'm alright man. Really."
joey,"Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... [Fun Bobby picks Joey up off the ground, bounces him. Joey laughs.] Alright! It still works."
joey,I just had a glass.
ross,Oooooh.
joey,[realizing what everyone else did a minute ago] Ooooooh.
ross,"Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand."
joey,"Monica, have you ever been with him when he"
monica,"Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!"
joey,Cool.
phoebe,Let's see!
ross,"That's fine, I'll just wait!"
monica,"Oh, sorry."
joey,"Sorry, sorry."
ross,Monica!
rachel,"Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet."
phoebe,"Wow, look at these prices."
rachel,"Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching."
joey,"What are these, like famous chickens?"
chandler,"Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. (to Ross) I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?"
ross,"Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?"
chandler,"Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number."
ross,"Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?"
monica,"Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns."
ross,That sounds great. Same for me.
joey,"Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?"
rachel,"Ok, I will have the uh, (whispers) side salad."
rachel,"Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?"
phoebe,"Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care."
chandler,"I will have the uh, Cajun catfish."
chandler,"Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?"
ross,"(using calculator) Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks."
rachel,"Um, everyone?"
ross,"Oh, you're right, I'm sorry."
joey,Thank you.
ross,"Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay."
monica,"Oh, thank you!"
ross,"So five of us is, $33.50 apiece."
phoebe,"No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen."
chandler,"Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback."
phoebe,"I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just..."
ross,"Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal."
phoebe,Not for you.
monica,"All right, what's goin' on?"
rachel,"Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable."
monica,"Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist."
phoebe,"Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my god, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?"
chandler,"You know, it's...something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back."
joey,"I gotta get one, too."
ross,What are you guys doing?
chandler,We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
ross,"Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world."
joey,"Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it."
ross,"This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on."
chandler,"Carol, Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?"
joey,"Uh, does it hurt?"
joey,Chandler?
chandler,"So, uh, how often can you do it?"
joey,"Ok, I got one, I got one. If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?"
rachel,"Yeah, I forget which ones."
rachel,Thank you. What a bitch.
phoebe,"I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet."
monica,"Ok, um, I'll go with you."
rachel,"No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so I'm takin' 'em down. Ok? Whoa! (She falls off the balcony)"
rachel,"I'm ok! I'm ok! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?"
chandler,"Hey, Rache, can I get--"
rachel,Did you talk to him?
chandler,Not yet.
rachel,"Then, no."
chandler,"So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know."
ross,"I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?"
chandler,God?
ross,"It was you, pal."
chandler,"Well, maybe it was God, doing me."
ross,"Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you."
chandler,"Well, you owe me one, big guy."
rachel,Here's your lemonade.
ross,I didn't order lemonade.
rachel,"Oh. Well than, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that."
ross,But--
rachel,"Go go go go, come on! Well, what did you find out?"
chandler,"He said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself without any outside help whatsoever."
ross,How is that the silver lining?
chandler,You have to really wanna see it.
joey,Hey.
joey,"Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for"
joey,With a man?
joey,"What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?"
joey,"Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday."
joey,No.
joey,"OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady..."
joey,"Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in."
ross,What? What's wrong?
ross,Alright.
ross,Hi.
ross,"Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?"
ross,A date.
ross,"Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh"
ross,"Yes, yes I am. And you are a...."
ross,"Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you."
ross,"I, uh, well... I... I met Russ."
ross,"Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people."
ross,"Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal..."
ross,"OK, well, um, have a nice evening."
ross,[upset] She's dating.
ross,What do you mean?
ross,"See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence."
ross,....................Yeah.
joey,Hey.
joey,"Well, the part's mine if I want it."
joey,"Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady."
joey,"Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean,"
joey,"Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?"
phoebe,"Fine. All right, fine."
joey,Yeah.
chandler,You can tell us.
ross,"Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine."
joey,"Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you."
monica,Ok.
ross,I hear ya.
chandler,We can talk about that.
phoebe,"Well, then...Let's."
ross,"I, I just never think of money as an issue."
rachel,That's 'cause you have it.
ross,That's a good point.
chandler,"So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?"
joey,"'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla."
ross,"Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?"
rachel,"Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing."
monica,"If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift."
ross,G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
chandler,"No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish."
ross,"Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio."
phoebe,"No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert."
ross,"No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together."
monica,All of us.
chandler,Together.
ross,Not at the concert.
rachel,Ok.
joey,Yeah.
rachel,Thank you.
joey,Thanks.
phoebe,Yeah.
chandler,"So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?"
chandler,"Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?"
monica,"I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look."
phoebe,"Oh, it's like a skit."
ross,"Hi, honey."
chandler,"Hey, sweetums."
ross,Hello to the rest.
joey,Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
monica,"It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?"
chandler,"Come on, you're going to Bloomingdales with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship."
monica,But I'm--
phoebe,"Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street."
ross,"So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?"
monica,"Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal."
ross,"It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this."
monica,You're welcome.
phoebe,"Woof, woof."
joey,Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
joey,Who?
joey,What's he doin' in my section?
joey,"Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?"
joey,"Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory."
joey,Yeah. Bijan for men?
monica,"Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day."
phoebe,What?
monica,"We were shopping, and we had lunch."
phoebe,"Oh, all right. What did I have?"
monica,You had a salad.
phoebe,"Oh, no wonder I don't feel full."
rachel,"Hey, guys, what's up."
phoebe,"I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad."
rachel,"Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?"
phoebe,"Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur."
rachel,You went shopping for fur?
ross,"Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym."
monica,"Phoebes, you know what I'm thinking?"
phoebe,"Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?"
monica,"No, although now that's what I'm thinking."
phoebe,"All right, so what were you thinking?"
monica,"Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?"
phoebe,Oh. No.
monica,Why not?
phoebe,"Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak."
monica,No you're not.
phoebe,"I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings."
joey,"Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie."
ross,Hello? Hi.
chandler,Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
joey,Needs some clothes altered?
chandler,"No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk."
joey,"Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?"
chandler,You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
ross,"Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either. Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y--"
joey,I've never slept with someone for a part.
joey,Sorry.
joey,"Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. [pause] You know, after having slept with her."
joey,"I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General."
joey,"Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it."
ross,[condescendingly] Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
ross,"[to Russ] For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark."
ross,"Oh you do, do you?"
ross,Of... of what?
ross,"Hey, you're a doctor of"
ross,"No, no, let me finish."
ross,"No, you let me fini..."
ross,Hi.
ross,Where ya goin'?
ross,Ooooohhhh.
ross,"What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?"
joey,Hey.
ross,How'd the callback go?
joey,It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
joey,"Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way."
ross,Good for you.
joey,"But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part."
joey,"Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!"
joey,Alright... I've got to go shower. [leaves]
monica,"Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe."
ross,Whoo!
phoebe,Cool.
monica,"Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you."
ross,"But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?"
chandler,"By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall."
phoebe,"Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs."
rachel,You bought boobs?
phoebe,Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
joey,"Bijan for men? Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work we could go maybe grab a cup of coffee."
joey,"Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men?"
ross,"Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son."
rachel,"Oh, this is so cute."
ross,My mommies love me. That's clever.
monica,"Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju-- Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye."
rachel,"Did you just say Hi, Jew?"
monica,"Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith."
phoebe,"Ben, dinner!"
ross,"Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that."
phoebe,"Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok."
chandler,What did you just do?
phoebe,"I licked my arm, what?"
ross,It's breast milk.
phoebe,So?
rachel,"Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person."
joey,What is the big deal?
chandler,What did you just do?
ross,"Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
phoebe,You won't even taste it?
ross,No!
phoebe,Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
ross,Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
monica,"Hey, where is everybody?"
rachel,They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
monica,"Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket."
rachel,"Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon. Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?"
monica,You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
rachel,And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket
monica,That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
rachel,"Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?"
monica,Judy.
rachel,Who?
monica,Julie.
rachel,"Sorry, I thought you were talking to me."
ross,Rachel! I'll just call her back.
rachel,"Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have."
monica,"Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too."
rachel,"I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here."
chandler,"Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her."
joey,"You know, I think I was sixteen."
monica,"Please, just a little bit off the back."
phoebe,"I'm still on ""no""."
rachel,"Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?"
joey,"No no no no no, I'm not fallin' for that again."
phoebe,What's goin' on?
rachel,"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night."
chandler,What stupid thing did you do?
phoebe,Ewww!
rachel,"Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye."
monica,"Rachel, how did this happen?"
rachel,"I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night."
phoebe,Where?
rachel,At his apartment. Is this juice?
joey,"Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?"
rachel,"I know, I know I'm a pathetic loser."
monica,"Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad."
chandler,People do stupid things when they're upset.
monica,"My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't--but this is about your horrible mistake."
ross,"Hi. Sorry we're late but we were--well, there was touching."
phoebe,"Hey, hey Ross."
ross,"Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?"
ross,Come on.
chandler,"Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!"
monica,"It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat."
phoebe,So...Thank you.
ross,Could you be less enthused?
joey,"Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--"
monica,Like?
joey,Charity.
monica,Charity?
ross,We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
rachel,"Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big."
phoebe,"Actually, it makes us feel that big."
ross,"I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys."
chandler,"If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel."
joey,"Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel."
rachel,"Ok, we never shoulda talked about this."
phoebe,"I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now."
rachel,Me neither.
joey,Me too.
monica,"Guys, we bought the tickets."
phoebe,"Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff."
chandler,Why did you look at me when you said that?
monica,"Well, I guess now we can't go."
rachel,"What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?"
monica,You know what? You're right.
phoebe,Fine.
ross,Fine.
joey,Fine.
rachel,What?
monica,Jody.
rachel,You were with Julie?
monica,"Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping."
rachel,Oh. Oh my god.
monica,"Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me."
rachel,"Yeah, right."
monica,"Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out."
rachel,"Oh, please, you wanted to get caught."
monica,That is not true!
rachel,"Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?"
monica,Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
rachel,"Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdales? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now."
monica,"Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanna, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve."
phoebe,"Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out."
ross,I did not freak out.
ross,Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
ross,"So, uh, he's back."
rachel,"Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?"
ross,"No, not a problem."
rachel,I'm glad it's not a problem.
phoebe,"Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass."
chandler,"Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered."
joey,"Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey says hello. He'll know what it means."
chandler,Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
monica,"You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter."
phoebe,"All right. Ok, but, but you have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it."
monica,I promise.
phoebe,"All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing."
phoebe,"All right, that's it, I quit."
chandler,Fine.
rachel,Fine.
monica,All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
ross,Chandler!
chandler,Yeah?
ross,Geez! Are you ready?
chandler,Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
ross,Whoa! You had sex today?
chandler,"Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming."
ross,Wow.
chandler,"Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign."
ross,Still doing the screening thing?
chandler,I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
chandler,Bob here.
chandler,"So, uh, you met someone, huh?"
chandler,"So, uh, how was he?"
chandler,Eh?
chandler,"Well, that makes me feel so good."
ross,(silently mouthing) Bumpy?
chandler,"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it."
monica,You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
ross,"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here."
chandler,"So, let's go."
ross,"Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song."
chandler,"Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now."
monica,"You know, the guys are probably having a great time."
joey,"Come on you guys, one more time."
phoebe,Ok. One.
joey,Nooo.
monica,That was amazing!
ross,"Excellent, that was excellent."
chandler,I can't believe the guys missed this.
ross,"No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults."
chandler,Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
ross,That would be no.
phoebe,Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
joey,"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh--"
joey,Exactly.
ross,You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
ross,"Oh, you've tasted it."
ross,Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
chandler,Howdy.
joey,"Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre."
chandler,"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."
joey,"Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day."
chandler,What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
joey,"I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese."
chandler,"All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?"
joey,Yeah I guess you're right.
chandler,You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
joey,I'm gonna do it.
chandler,All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
monica,I don't know what else to say.
rachel,"Well that works out good, because I'm not listening."
monica,"I feel terrible, I really do."
rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?"
monica,"Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?"
rachel,Yes.
monica,It's that terrible?
rachel,"Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually, but now she's actually stealing you."
monica,What? I didn't say anything.
phoebe,"Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person."
monica,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed."
phoebe,Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
monica,How who wears it?
phoebe,Demi Moore.
monica,Demi Moore is not a he.
phoebe,"Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten."
monica,That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
phoebe,"Oh, oh, oh my god!"
monica,Oh my god!
phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?"
monica,"She's the actress who was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost."
phoebe,"Oh, she's got gorgeous hair."
monica,I KNOW!
ross,"What guys? Oh, yeah."
monica,Do I know you?
monica,"Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?"
monica,You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
monica,"Uh, wait, backstage?"
ross,Ross.
chandler,Chandler.
ross,"Hey, you guys."
rachel,Happy birthday.
ross,"Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?"
rachel,"Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?"
monica,"Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?"
rachel,"Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?"
monica,"Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you."
rachel,I love you too.
phoebe,"You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that."
monica,"Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?"
rachel,"I'd do anything for you, you know that."
monica,I'd do anything for you.
phoebe,"Wait, wait, wait, wait!"
joey,"Mornin'. I said, mornin'."
joey,"Yeah, I'm ready."
joey,"These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?"
rachel,"So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"
rachel,Really? Me?
rachel,"Well, you're not totally paranoid."
rachel,"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
ross,"And, uh, and then I kissed her."
joey,Tongue?
ross,Yeah.
joey,Cool.
joey,"[reading over her shoulder] Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?"
joey,"No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then... [rubs his fingers together]"
ross,Hi.
ross,"That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful"
ross,"Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?"
joey,You got all that from saline solution?
ross,"Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... [Rachel enters, carrying a tray]... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel."
ross,How are you?
chandler,At least as long as I have the pants.
rachel,How is she?
phoebe,"It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign."
ross,How's the hair?
phoebe,"I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling."
joey,Can we see her?
phoebe,"Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, you come on in."
joey,How're you doing?
rachel,I'm ok.
joey,"Ooh, that bad, huh? Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts."
rachel,"When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, then 50 feet of crap, then me."
joey,You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
rachel,Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
joey,What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
rachel,"I don't know, I don't know."
joey,"Look, Rache, Rache, I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you."
chandler,"Yo, paisan. Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man."
joey,Frankie? What're you talking about?
monica,"Uh, good."
ross,"Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust."
chandler,"Yeah, we really missed you guys."
joey,"Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid."
phoebe,"We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?"
monica,"No, I just, I fell down."
rachel,On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
monica,"You know, a party, or--"
rachel,What party?
ross,"It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band."
joey,You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
chandler,"Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this."
rachel,Who gave you that hickey?
monica,That would be the work of a Blowfish.
rachel,Oh!
phoebe,"Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, ""hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck""."
ross,"Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know."
rachel,"What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?"
monica,It's work.
chandler,I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
joey,And we don't work hard?
monica,"(on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page."
chandler,I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
joey,And you feel like we hold you back.
chandler,Yes.
rachel,Oh!
chandler,No.
rachel,"Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it."
rachel,"All right, Julie. What a manipulative bitch."
ross,Good.
ross,"Hi, Julie. [nervous] Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?"
ross,"[uncomfortable] Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?"
ross,[impatient] Play it.
joey,"Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses."
ross,[to Joey] Ssshh.
ross,"I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare."
joey,"Hey, here's a thought, Ross. [reaches for the computer]"
joey,"Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome."
ross,Can't we just use a pen?
joey,"Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first."
ross,"I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes."
joey,You could say that.
ross,"And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress."
ross,I don't know.
joey,"Oh, her ankles are a little chubby."
ross,[long pause] She's not Rachel.
joey,"[to Ross] Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?"
ross,"Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing."
ross,"Hey, what's goin' on?"
chandler,Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
ross,What?
joey,No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
chandler,"He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite--"
ross,what?
chandler,Cupping.
joey,"That's how they do pants. First they go up one side, they move it over, they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?"
ross,"Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?"
joey,What? That's not? Oh my god.
monica,Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
ross,"I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten."
monica,Thank you. My hair is very amused.
chandler,"Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true."
phoebe,Thank you.
ross,"Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rache."
monica,"Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired."
phoebe,Oh.
joey,Let me get that. (to Chandler) You got five bucks?
ross,Hi.
ross,"I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's."
ross,"No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing."
ross,"Well, uh."
joey,"He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes."
ross,"Really. It's always been you, Rach."
ross,"I know, I know, it's, it's almost...[turns around, sees Chandler and Joey] What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?"
ross,"Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat."
ross,"Hey, someone order a coat?"
ross,"He won't? [remembers what it is] He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?"
joey,"Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?"
ross,That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
ross,"No, you don't."
rachel,"Wait, are you leaving?"
ross,"Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by ""bye!"""
joey,"Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test..."
chandler,That's ok.
ross,What's goin' on?
rachel,"Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all, what?"
ross,"Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?"
rachel,No.
ross,"Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that. You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking ""Oh my god, I'm with Rachel"". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?"
ross,"Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?"
ross,"Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type ""little"", the idiot."
ross,"No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?"
ross,"No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column."
ross,"No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?"
joey,"Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea."
ross,"Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!"
ross,I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
ross,"[reading his list] Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben."
ross,Number six: the way you smell.
rachel,"No, I think that was the whole all."
joey,"I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants."
phoebe,You wanna do it right now?
phoebe,"Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andy McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?"
rachel,No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andy McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
phoebe,"Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you."
rachel,You're welcome.
joey,"[opens the drapes] Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?"
ross,"Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?"
joey,"Oh, yeah, I do."
ross,"I am, uh, I am..."
ross,"Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance."
ross,No?
ross,"Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel."
ross,"No, but, but I wanna be with you in"
ross,"You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you."
joey,"[quietly] I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? [Ross stares blankly at him] Maybe a little longer."
ross,Hi.
ross,"Look, can, can you do something for me?"

chandler,"Blue blazer *back*. He, he wants it *back*."

chandler,[Chandler glares at her and then changes the subject.] So what job did you get Joe?
joey,"Oh, tour guide at the Museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me."
rachel,Don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?

ross,You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
phoebe,Hey what are you guys looking at?
chandler,Ross and the most beautiful girl in
phoebe,"Yeah, come to papa."
ross,I know!
monica,"Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the"
chandler,"Where did you, when did you, how did you... (Joey hits the back of Chandler's head) How did you get a girl like that?"
rachel,"Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?"
ross,"Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era."
chandler,"Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era."
ross,"I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow."
rachel,Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
ross,Fine by me; hope she wins.
chandler,Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
phoebe,Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
chandler,"Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago."
phoebe,"Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?"
chandler,"Well, I have a call in about that."
phoebe,'Kay.

chandler,You're going to carry their child and get them a Sony Play Station?
rachel,"Honey, this is really an incredible thing to do for them but there are things to think about."
monica,"Yeah, I mean you'd be pregnant. I mean, pregnant."
phoebe,I know.
ross,"Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot. I mean, morning sickness, uh, labour. And it's all for somebody else."
phoebe,"Yeah, what's your point? [goes to sit on the couch]"
ross,The stuff I just mentioned.
rachel,"Wow, I don't know if I could ever do that. You know, I always figured the first time I had a baby, it would be with someone I love and that baby would be like, a keeper."
phoebe,"You know, you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture."
joey,"Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy."
monica,We just want you to think it through.
rachel,Why don't you talk to someone who's had a baby. Like your mom.
phoebe,"My mom never gave birth. Oh, but my birth mom did!"
chandler,"Oh, yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway. It came with the pants."
rachel,"I am so jealous. You guys are just, really, right *there*, aren't you?"
chandler,Yes. Right where?
monica,"In the beginning, you know, where it's all sex and talking and sex and talking..."
chandler,"Yeah, you've, you've got to love the talking."
monica,And the sex?

rachel,"Oh,"
chandler,"Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils."
rachel,"Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair."
chandler,"Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren."
rachel,"Oh, honey, that's so sweet."
phoebe,"Yeah, and what a great way to say, ""I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"""
chandler,It doesn't say that. Does it?
ross,How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful
chandler,"Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great."
phoebe,It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
monica,"(Entering from her bedroom, talking on the phone) Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. (To the gang) I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people."
rachel,Oh my God! What happened?
monica,Sixty
ross,"So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?"
monica,Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
phoebe,"Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... (Monica looks almost puzzled) ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?"
monica,I don't know.
phoebe,"There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!"
monica,Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
phoebe,"Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months."

ross,"Yeah, that is nice......lying!! No way is that the reason."
rachel,"Why, just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?"
chandler,"No, he's right, I'm totally lying."
monica,Then what is it?
chandler,"Well, Kathy's last girlfriend was Joey."
ross,And you're afraid you won't be able to *fill his shoes*. [grins]
chandler,"No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him."
ross,"[stops grinning] Yeah, I was going for the metaphor."
chandler,Yes and I was saying the actual words.
monica,"Big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends. That doesn't mean he's good in bed."
chandler,We share a wall. So either he's great in bed or she just liked to agree with him a lot.
monica,"Sweetie, with you it's going to be different. The sex is going to be great 'cause you guys are in love."

chandler,A
joey,It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
chandler,Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
joey,Why not?
chandler,Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
rachel,"Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?"
joey,"Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... ""Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"""

monica,I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me. [Rachel puts her arm consolingly around Monica]
joey,"Look, Ross, really, it's no big deal. You know, you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then, so be it. I understand. When I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So, you know, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow. [leaves]"
rachel,"Yeah, when we're in the audience, he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave."
chandler,[enters] Hey. Why's Phoebe singing to Karl Malden?
phoebe,"Oh, you know what? I think it's time for the puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go on the balcony. [gets up with puppy]"

joey,"Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?"
chandler,Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
joey,Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
phoebe,"But Mon, you have to get our money!"
monica,"Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant."
phoebe,"I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?"
monica,What?
phoebe,"Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, ""that massage wasn't long enough, or, ""I don't recognize any of those songs,"" or, you know, ""these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"""
monica,Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
phoebe,"Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill."
monica,"Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me."
phoebe,She seems fine now.
joey,"So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?"
ross,You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
joey,Yeah.
ross,"Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! (Ross takes the loosely tied tie off and hands it to Joey who puts it on.) Here."

monica,"Well, it was the first time. You know, there's not always a lot of agreement on the first time."
rachel,"Yeah, not for girls anyway. Guys agree [snaps her fingers] like that."
chandler,"Look, you have to help me, okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman. I know where everything goes. It's always...nice. But I need to know what makes it go from ""nice"" to ""My God, somebody's killing her in there!"""
monica,"All right, I'm going to show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, hand me that pad over there. [Rach gets a pad and pen off the table and hands it to Monica.] All right. Now...[starts to draw]"
chandler,"You don't have to draw an actual wo -- [looks at Monica's drawing] Woah, she' hot."
monica,"Now, everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got, [starts labelling her diagram] one, two, three, [Chandler nods impatiently], four [now Chandle looks up, surprised], five, six, and seven."
chandler,[shocked] There are seven?
rachel,Let me see that. [looks at the drawing] Oh yeah.
chandler,[points to diagram] That's one?

chandler,
joey,(Pointing at Chandler.) Your different here too. Your mean in England. (Chandler throws his hands up to his head in frustration. They walk away from each other.)
ross,"whats up, Dad?"
ross,"(Holding him back.)Dad, dad, please. Look I dont want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. (Picks up the bill.) Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?"

chandler,"Id like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. (No one in the room laughs. He starts to get flustered.) Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (Ross looks embarrassed.) And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he over inflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in the room laughs.) Ohh, Dear God.. (A cellular phone rings.)"

monica,"Well, thanks, we like him."
ross,"Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding."
chandler,"The guy was hammered, okay? Theres no way, you look like Rosss mother."
monica,Then why would he say it?
chandler,Because hes crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
monica,"Oh, my mothers right. Im never going to get married."
chandler,"Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldnt want you?"
monica,"Ohh, Please?! Im a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!"
rachel,"Hi, Im back. Listen, I need to..."
rachel,Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
rachel,"Okay, you know what/ Youre going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up."
rachel,"Sure, you know what? Come on, well just tell them that there was like a problem with like the ""engine""."
rachel,"Look, If I dont get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!"
rachel,"All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!! (She pounds her hand on the counter twice. The ticket agent counters by placing the closed sign on the counter and tapping it twice.)"

chandler,"Hi, my names Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?"
joey,"Sure, neighbor come on in."
chandler,"So, is Janine around?"
joey,"Uh, no, shes at dance class."
chandler,Can I check out what she did to my room?
joey,"Yeah, but, hey look, dont go through her stuff. She gets really mad.(Chandler gives him a look and walks to the door of his old room.)"
chandler,"(The room is filled with flowers and a floral print sheet on the bed.) Oh my God. What is th its like a guy never lived in here. Look, youve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. (Looking around the living room.) Its spreading already."
joey,(Looking around the room.) It is???
chandler,"(Picking up a pillow.) Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?"
joey,No.
chandler,"(Pointing to the table and picking up the box.) Is that your tiny little box, thats too small to put anything in?"
joey,No.
chandler,"No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, youre going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff."

chandler,"Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?"

rachel,"Well, sure, but they might think its kinda weird considering I dont work there anymore."
phoebe,Oh my God. What happened?
rachel,"I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren."
phoebe,Well thats great! Congratulations!! (She hugs Rachel.)
rachel,Yeah. (chuckling) A year ago..
phoebe,(Hugging her again.) Youve lasted a whole year. Good for you.
rachel,"But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesnt see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesnt like me very much."
chandler,Thats weird. I dont think my boss likes me either.
monica,I dont think mine likes me either.
ross,Maybe its a universal thing?
joey,"Or maybe, its because youre hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday. (Everybody gets up.)"
chandler,Yeah lets head off to work.
monica,We should go.
phoebe,Thank you.
rachel,Sure.
phoebe,"Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in."
rachel,Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
phoebe,Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
rachel,What? What!?! You kissed him?

joey,"Look I dont know this baby. I dont know if shes a famous artist or not. You know, and I dont want to be a jerk but youre changing too much around here."
joey,"Yeah but its too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can."

rachel,"Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more."
phoebe,Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
rachel,To get you to make out with him!!!
phoebe,Ohhh.
monica,"(Holding a shirt in front of Ross.) Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. (Ross has a big smile.) Nope. Okay, colors that dont work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple."
ross,I dont know what Im going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
monica,"Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldnt look so bright."
ross,Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
monica,"Im just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you."
ross,Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Were not 13 anymore.

ross,"But, wont she notice I have makeup on?"
monica,Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
ross,What??
monica,"All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see."
ross,No. I am not putting on makeup. (Knock at the door. Phoebe enters.)
phoebe,Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? (He smiles at her.) OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
monica,Now are drawers will smell nice and we didnt waste these pantyhose.
chandler,"Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? Im going to go over to Joeys."
monica,"Wait, were supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer."
chandler,"Yes, but I feel like Ive really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think were two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple."
monica,"You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. Youre right, Im sorry."
chandler,"Nah, Nah, its okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing."
monica,Yeah. Go over to Joeys. Go over to Joeys and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
chandler,You know when guys hang out they dont just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
monica,"When girls hang out, we dont have pillow fights in our underwear. (Chandler gets a hurt look on his face.) Im sorry. We do. We do. I dont know why I said that."
joey,Hey Chandler. Come on in. Were knitting pot holders.
chandler,"No thanks, Josephine."
chandler,"Hey Ross, I was wondering if"

rachel,No.
rachel,"Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him."
rachel,I-I dont want your job. I-I dont. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I dont even know how to use my keycard. (The elevator stops. Ralph steps on.)
ross,Mmm-Hmm.
ross,Mmm.
ross,Mm-Hmm.
ross,(Chuckling) Hmm-Hmm.
ross,Mmm-Unmm.
ross,"Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Putting his hand up to block his mouth.) Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, lets talk more about you. Hmm."
joey,"So whats really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer."
monica,"Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip."
chandler,"Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers."
monica,"Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because Im going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter."
joey,"Ohh, I love birds. (Monica leaves. Chandler shuts the door.)"
chandler,What is the matter with you ?!?
joey,What?
chandler,"Youre arranging flowers! (Pointing to the dish on the table.) You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!"
joey,"Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers theyre just, you know, theyre nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby."
chandler,Youre turning into a women.
joey,No Im not. Why would you say that? Thats just mean.

phoebe,But why didnt you just tell her the truth.
rachel,I did but she doesnt think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
phoebe,"Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?"
rachel,"You were with Kenny today, werent you?"
phoebe,Just for a second.
rachel,"Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?"
phoebe,"Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren."
rachel,"Im not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldnt."
phoebe,"Ohh, sleep with Kenny."

rachel,"(Faking crying.) Yeah, he dumped me. He said, ""Rachel, I cant do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I cant do this. Im married and Im sorry."" And then I dont know why but he said, ""and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."""
rachel,Of course its true and it hurts so bad.
rachel,You and Ralph?
joey,"Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you."

chandler,What is it?
monica,I drew you a bath!
chandler,"Honey, I dont like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?"
monica,"Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So its a boy bath!"
chandler,"Well, this does butch it up a bit."
monica,"I swear, if you try it, you will love it!"
chandler,"All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?"

rachel,"(looking at the bulletin board with baby pictures) So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?"

chandler,"I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The waters tepid. The salt didnt dissolve and is now lodged places. And the scents I used dont compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomileOh!"

chandler,I dont know! Joey hasnt had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in
monica,(groans) That was a long night.

chandler,But what did he mean by rules?
monica,Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!
chandler,Because he was looking at her differently.
monica,"And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!"
chandler,My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
phoebe,(from outside the bathroom) You guys?

chandler,You dont say anything.

rachel,I didnt see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
ross,"I dont think so! Youre just giving me Ruth so youll get to name it when its a boy, and thats when youll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia."

joey,"She made me switch to light Mayo. Thats it! Thats all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!"

phoebe,"Thats right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know Ive had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And Im sure youve had them for us."
joey,Not really.
phoebe,Mm-hmm. (To herself) Throw me a bone here.
ross,"So, I uh I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby."
rachel,What?
ross,Thats right. The student has become the master.
rachel,"Ross, I swear, I dont know."
ross,"Oh, come on, you know its a girl!"

chandler,Do I smell essential oils?
monica,"Yeah, Im going to take a bath. Im just going to get a magazine."
chandler,Okay.
monica,What do you think youre doing?
chandler,L-leaving my troubles behind?
monica,"I know that youre new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum."

phoebe,"Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey."
chandler,(To Monica) You told her?!

phoebe,"Well, you were wrong, he doesnt like me!"
monica,What?
phoebe,"Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didnt like you? How would you feel?"

chandler,You like Rachel?!
joey,"Its no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. Its just a crush! Its going to go away! (Looks down) Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!"

joey,"Oh, okay."
phoebe,"So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?"
ross,"Oh, Im actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, shes been away all week visiting her parents, but shell be cool. I mean, shes been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, Fossils are my friends."

phoebe,"(knocking and entering) Hey. Look, I know youve been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate."

rachel,(entering) Hi.

rachel,"(talking with a higher voice, and puckered lips kind of like you do to a baby or...well a puppy its hard to explain. Just use your imagination!) Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but Ive got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. (still talking like that) Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously cant stop it. (exits)"
joey,"(to the dog) Cmere. Hey. Cmere. Thats Rachel. Shes the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with youwe love her. But we cant have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? Youre a guy. (thinks about it and picks up the dog and looks) Well, you used to be."
monica,(entering from her bedroom) So what do you think? (referring to her outfit)
monica,(to herself) Ive still got it!
chandler,(pointing at the video) Why did you get me this?
monica,What is it?
chandler,"Its yelling bleeding dilating. Oh, the dilating"
monica,"Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebes. Why were you even watching it?"
chandler,I thought maybe you got me porn for Valentines Day.
monica,"Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentines Day (pulls a video out of a basket) you were right! Apparently, its about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! (looks closer) Oh, wait a minute. Those arent stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?"
chandler,"Well, Im not really in a sexy mood right now."
monica,"Honey, whats going on?"
chandler,"Well, remember the first time we saw"
monica,Mm-hmm.
chandler,How long it took to go back in the water?
monica,"Chandler, we cant let this tape wreck Valentines Day!"
chandler,You dont know. You didnt see it.
monica,"Child-birth, its a natural thing! Its beautiful."
chandler,"Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? (picks up the remote and presses a button, and he immediately makes a face that just looks like hes going to throw up!)"

monica,Dont touch me!
ross,"Hey! (they hug) So, how was Atlantic City?"
ross,Yeah?
ross,"Wha? Oh, come on. You didnt have tosaltwater taffy?! (Mona laughs) Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but its actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. Thats not interesting."
ross,I do too! I missed you!
ross,"Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!"
ross,Yeah! I know! It was. Oh the only sad thing is I wasnt around when it happened for the first time.
ross,"Yeah, Im missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me."
ross,What?
ross,(not amused) Huh uh-huh.
ross,"(with his mouth full) Just a second! (he fake laughs, but turns his head and starts to break down)"

ross,"I dont know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!"
phoebe,"Taffy, really? Ive never had any."
ross,Ever?!
phoebe,"Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. (Ross hands her one) Thank you! So what, youre just never going to tell her?"
ross,"Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, Im going to take her to an amazing Valentines dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks Im the best boyfriend in the world, then Im going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me."
phoebe,"If I havent said it before: shes a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going towhat the mother of crap is up with this stuff? (Referring to the taffy, which shes been chewing this whole time.) Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? Whats the deal? (she swallows it, finally) Oh, its nice! May I try a pink one?"
joey,"So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isnt going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat."
phoebe,(entering) Hey!
joey,Hey.
phoebe,"Hey, buddy. Hows my favorite dog, huh? Hows my favorite dog? (the dog doesnt move) Youre subdued. (to Joey) Did you give him a beer?"
joey,No.
phoebe,"Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment."
joey,"Yeah, sure. Go ahead. (pause) Oh, me, right!"
phoebe,Hes miserable! What happened to him?
joey,Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
phoebe,What stuff?
joey,Rachel stuff.
phoebe,"Oh Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!"
joey,Hes breathing!
phoebe,"Okay, Im going to take him back to Wendys."
joey,"No, no, no, no! Hes fine! Look, look, look! (picks up the ball) Heres your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! (he throws the ball and it bounces right next to the dog) Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!"
ross,"Well, Im, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?"
rachel,"Oh, Ive got big Valentines plans! Ive got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!"
ross,"Yknow, its interesting! Most people think thats made with seawater, when in fact"
rachel,"Ross, we actually watched the documentary together."
rachel,Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! (runs to her room to get her money)

ross,I have no idea!
rachel,Ill be watching TV if anybody needs me. (exits to her room)
ross,"Uh lately, she just likes hanging out here."
ross,I think shes lonely.
ross,I know.
ross,"No, no. Shes way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy."
rachel,Im not here! Thats just my Chinese food!
ross,"Mm-hmm. Shesshes emotional, but, but ballsy."
rachel,"You know what Im going to do? Im going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed! (exits)"
ross,"And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why dont you, uh, open the champagne, and Ill be right back. Ive got a surprise for you."
ross,(fakes a laugh) Please start drinking! (exits)
rachel,(entering) Im just going to grab the phone.
rachel,"Oh, Im sorry! Do you need the phone?"
rachel,"(as Ross enters with a present) But, but, Mona, I live here."
ross,(handing Mona the present) Happy Valentines Day! Or something to remember me by.
monica,How long has it been this time?
chandler,90 seconds.
monica,Thats better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it except all I did was think about it.
chandler,"You know, it haunts me? Up til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!"
monica,"Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why dont we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?"
chandler,I can do that.
monica,Okay.
chandler,Okay. Now all weve got to do is get rid of this chair.

rachel,"Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! (Pause) I’m not helping."
ross,"So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?"
rachel,That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
ross,"So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend."
rachel,Well—Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
ross,"Well, Chandler’s my oldest friend, but Joey’s my—No! Ah! (points at Rachel)"
rachel,Ooooo!
joey,"(Enters) Hey you guys I’m gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye."
ross,Rachel said she’d marry you?!
joey,"(He looks around the room) This isn’t the right room, sorry folks. (leaves)"
monica,"Ok, I don’t wanna be negative so I’ll say that most of the signs you bought are good."
phoebe,"No they ran out of ""It’s a girl"" but I can fix this one, (She writes ""not"" in between it’s and a) See?"
monica,(looking at Chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) So sexy. (Waking him up.) Honey.
chandler,Yea yea. (Pulls the balloon out of his mouth)
monica,Honey why don’t you go lie down.
chandler,"No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office (Pulls another balloon out of his mouth) Am I producing them?"
joey,Why’re you so tired?
chandler,"Couldn’t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn’t sleep. Y’know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I’ll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn’t fall asleep."
joey,"You know what you should’ve done, you should have told yourself that little story."
rachel,(enters with Emma) Hi!
monica,Phoebe did the signs!
phoebe,"...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;"
joey,"(impressed) Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?"
phoebe,(smiling) Uh-huh.
chandler,"(coming from the bedroom) Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa."
monica,I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
ross,You're really not coming back?
chandler,"Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by"
monica,"It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!"
chandler,"So, who does?"
phoebe,"Oh, I like my job."
joey,I *love* my job.
rachel,"Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work."
ross,I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
chandler,I'm sorry I won't be here.
monica,"It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week,"
chandler,Thanks. (they kiss) I'll see you new year's day.
monica,(shocked) You're not gonna be here new year's eve??
chandler,Did I not mention that?
monica,No!
chandler,"(thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming:)"
chandler,"All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas eve and you'd"
chandler,Hey. Where've you been?
chandler,"(to the others) You hear that? You may not be with your familys,"
chandler,"Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts"
chandler,"Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want"
chandler,"I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with"
chandler,"Haha, no thanks!"
chandler,"Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a"
chandler,"Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty"
phoebe,"So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some"
rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back"
chandler,"I can save you time ladies, I'm right here."
phoebe,"Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern"
rachel,We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.

monica,I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
chandler,I'm not sure what they did...but I'm inclined to blame ***
monica,"I guess with you doing the internship, we're spending more than we're bringing in."
chandler,Maybe i should quit and get a job that pays.
monica,Oh...But you're finally doing something that you love! i can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was..y'know..finding gold
chandler,You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month. And maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refridgerator for a change. You're chef..what can you make out of bacon soda and beer?
monica,Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
chandler,No! We're not borrowing money.
monica,Why not?
chandler,Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was...well to always knock before going into the poolhouse...But the other thing was...never borrow money.
monica,Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
chandler,That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And i'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
phoebe,Oh...you don't have to go...I have something that will fit you.
phoebe,I want you to stay.

chandler,I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
monica,"Well, I just lost my erection."
chandler,"I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?"
monica,You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.
chandler,But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.
monica,"Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There"
chandler,Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
monica,I know!!! My erection is back!
joey,(To Gunther who comes over with coffee and a muffin) Thank you!
phoebe,"Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?"
joey,Okay.
joey,": Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?"
phoebe,"I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash."
joey,If you want I could loan you some money?
phoebe,"Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore."
joey,"Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?"
phoebe,You could do that?
joey,"Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need."

chandler,Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever
ross,OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
chandler,No!
ross,OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
chandler,Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said
ross,"Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,"
chandler,So are you gonna...talk to her?
ross,"Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!"
chandler,"You know when ""That's fine"" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!"
ross,No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know
chandler,No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
ross,I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.
chandler,"Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!"
ross,"Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental"

monica,"Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? Its here."
chandler,"Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: dont watch it."
rachel,Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
chandler,"Well, lets just say its ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself."
rachel,"Well, now, wait. Now Im all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me."
monica,"No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!"
rachel,"Cmon, seriously, you guys, youre not going to make me watch this alone!"
monica,"Shes right of course not. Honey, get the tape."
chandler,"(with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (Chandler puts the tape in, and they all sit down) Okay, here we go."
rachel,"Okay. (watching the tape) Ooh, my! (Rachel jumps when the woman starts screaming) Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!"
chandler,Why have I seen this thing three times?!

joey,Hey so where’s Ross?
rachel,He’s downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
joey,Is he still mad at us?
rachel,"Well, you more then me, but he can’t stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby."
joey,That’s not fair! I can’t do that.
rachel,"Yeah, I’m not so sure you should be here when he comes up."
joey,"See this is what I was afraid of, I didn’t think I should be here either but somebody (Looks at Chandler) said he’d be over it by now."
chandler,"Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla."
chandler,Walter (nods).
phoebe,She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.

ross,(enters from the bed room) Okay I put most of the stuff away.
rachel,"Oh great, the pacifiers?"
chandler,"Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible."
phoebe,"No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that"
rachel,"Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and"
chandler,"No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!"
phoebe,"Oh no, we have to!"
chandler,"No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too."

chandler,Why?
rachel,"Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for"

phoebe,"I've always wanted to live with a guy..""Pick up your socks!"" ""Put down the toilet seat!"" ""No! We're not having sex anymore!"" It's gonna be fun!"
monica,Hey Joey!
joey,Hey!
monica,Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you..Will Never get back to Chandler.
joey,I'd be lying if i said i haven't thought about it myself...Chandler is my best friend..It would be wrong. Good...(He winks)...But wrong.
joey,Awww..I don't know Monica...You know...erm...lending friends money is always a mistake.

rachel,"Well, because if one more person says ""what a cute little boy"" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!"
ross,"I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?"
monica,"(Flipping through bunch of folders as Chandler enters from bathroom) Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key"
chandler,How long was I in there?
monica,Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.
chandler,Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
monica,Don't you want to look through the rest?
chandler,"I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though."
monica,"You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!"
chandler,"I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? ""Cheese. It's milk that you chew."" ""Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy."" ""A grape."
monica,"I got one. ""Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."""
chandler,Honey? Leave it to the pros.
monica,I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.
chandler,"""The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."""
chandler,Why did I get married?!
joey,Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I
phoebe,Well it depends.
joey,On...?
phoebe,On how far along he's in the sex change process!
monica,"No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,"
joey,Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
phoebe,Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
joey,Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
phoebe,Wow! Talking about high maintenance
joey,Hey hey! You dye your hair!
phoebe,I'm a woman!
joey,Arghhh! Double standards!
phoebe,"Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?"
monica,Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
phoebe,"But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out"
monica,"It's just, I'm not good at singing."
phoebe,Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
monica,"No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!"
phoebe,OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.
monica,So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?

monica,Isn’t she beautiful?
ross,What about Ben?
phoebe,"(taking Ross aside) Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?"
ross,"Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room."
phoebe,"Yay! It’s so exciting! Wow, you could’ve done that with us there."
ross,Yeah right.
phoebe,"Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can’t talk to Rachel."
ross,What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
phoebe,"Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy."
joey,"(taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?"
chandler,Sure.
joey,Dude I just did something terrible.
chandler,That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
joey,"No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!"
chandler,What?! Why does she think that?
joey,Because it kinda looked like I did.
chandler,"Again, what?!"
joey,"Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…"
chandler,As we all are at some point during the day.
joey,It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!

joey,"Oh, man, Im sorry. Why?"
ross,"Well, with everything thats been going on lately, I havent exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didnt tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?"
joey,"Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentines Day."

rachel,Hi you guys!
joey,Oo...what's in the bag?
rachel,"Oh er..well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment."
joey,"Oh...baby-proofing...Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know..when I was a kid it was like.. ""Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!"" or er.. ""Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!"" Huh!"

chandler,"No, no. But let me show you what I can do. ""Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."""
chandler,Really? That's great!
chandler,"It's funny. When you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid."""
chandler,"Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right"
rachel,"Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?"
rachel,A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
rachel,"Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way"
rachel,Excuse me?
monica,I'm there!
rachel,Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.
phoebe,Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there
rachel,No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
phoebe,Oh my god.
monica,You kissed him?
rachel,"Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and..."
monica,Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?
phoebe,"It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper."
monica,Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
rachel,"You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf..."
monica,I thought you hated him?
rachel,"You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!"

chandler,"Well, what did she say?"
joey,(happily) She said yes.
chandler,Does Ross know?
joey,"Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?"
chandler,Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.
joey,"Oh, I like that. Yeah…"
chandler,"If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!"

joey,No!
ross,"I knew it. So, is she someone from work?"
joey,Yes.
ross,"Well, uh, does she like you?"
joey,"Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesnt matter, because I cant do anything about it."
ross,Why not?
joey,"Well, its complicated. Shes with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because were really good friends."
ross,"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he still in love with her?"

ross,Okay. Um is he a good guy?
joey,"Yeah, hes the best."

joey,Okay. What have we wanted to always do together?
chandler,Braid each other’s hair then ride horseback on the beach?

chandler,Courtside? Oh my god!!
joey,Wow the parade is really good this year/Man those horses can crap! [Looks sideways at the TV in disgust]
chandler,Muskogee? That's like four hours from Tulsa! WOO HOO!

chandler,Aren't you one of the stars of popular daytime soap Days of our Lives?
joey,Yeah!! I forgot I'm supposed to be there! I can't believe I forgot! I usually write stuff like this down on my arm!
joey,OH! Stupid long sleeves!
chandler,What are you going to do?
joey,"(sighs) I guess I'm going to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there! The producer is going to be so mad at me...He sat us all down yesterday and said everyone has to be there six AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani! (shrugs) Like I was some kind of idiot!"
chandler,"Well, you proved them wrong."
joey,Yeah...

chandler,"Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together"

phoebe,"Ooh, and treat it is. (Monica's breasts.)"
ross,"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent"
chandler,What?

ross,(to Chandler) What are you doing?
chandler,You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a
ross,"Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave."
chandler,Why?
ross,"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and,"
chandler,But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
ross,"I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me."

rachel,Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
joey,The hardware store is right down the street.
rachel,There is a hardware store right down the street?
phoebe,Hey you guys! Ok..we've got great news.
phoebe,I know it's so exciting! You know i've never lived with a guy before.
monica,"Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless...they're playing ""This is what my sister would look like""..(Looks at Chandler)"
chandler,Yeah...she's not so cute.

rachel,Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
rachel,That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.
rachel,"Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?"
rachel,Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?
rachel,"Oh, hi Mr. Zelner."
rachel,"That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?"
rachel,"(To herself) Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power."
rachel,Today.
rachel,"No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening."
joey,Hey.
monica,So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
rachel,"I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't"
monica,"Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross"
rachel,Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
phoebe,"Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!"
joey,Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
joey,Chandler Bing.
joey,OK Thanks.
joey,Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?
joey,Oh good...
joey,All right let's just do this.
joey,Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!
chandler,Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
ross,Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
chandler,"Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,"
ross,That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?

monica,"Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it’ll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?"
chandler,"I’m so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but no foreplay."
monica,Deal!
ross,Dad seriously! Y’know you really should see someone about that!
ross,"I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?"

chandler,But-t it’s courtside! The cheerleaders are gonna be right in … [mouths last words so Monica does not hear them]. That’s not the way to convince you.
monica,"Look. I don’t want to be one of those wives that says “You can’t go to the game”, “you have to spend time with me”, so, if you just realize it on your own?"
chandler,I…I…I know. You’re right. I wanna see you too. I’ve just got to figure out a way to tell Joey. He’s really looking forward to this.
monica,[On phone] Tell him you haven’t seen your wife in a long time. [In apartment] Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that…what little time that we have is precious.
chandler,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I’ll think of something."
ross,"Wow! You look…er…hm……I mean, it’s just the…er…that, that dress! Er…"
rachel,I hope the ends of these sentences are good!

ross,"So, are you. Ah! Are you excited about your…er…first night away from Emma?"
rachel,"Yeah! Phoebe and I are gonna have so much fun! Thank you for watching the baby, by the way."

ross,Still me.

chandler,"I'll tell you what. For the rest of our lives, I'll be careful, until told otherwise."
chandler,Wait a minute. This isn't the china we picked out...
monica,I know! After you left the store I chose different ones.
chandler,Why?
monica,"well, no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me."

Yeah..You know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.

phoebe,"I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor."
joey,"That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray."
phoebe,Joey.
joey,"No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she"
phoebe,Who dies?

phoebe,"Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!"
phoebe,"(Does the scene) Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?"
phoebe,"Okay, from the top, people!"
chandler,"Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing"
ross,"No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar."
chandler,Did she go out with him?
ross,"No. When he called, I...I threw the message away."
chandler,Ah! The high road...
ross,You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!
chandler,Are you trying to get everybody divorced?

rachel,Hi.
phoebe,Are you all right?
rachel,Uhh… I think I just got engaged.
phoebe,Oh my God! He did it?
rachel,Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?
phoebe,Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
rachel,And you really think this is a good idea?
phoebe,"I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people."
rachel,I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.
phoebe,"Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so."
rachel,Really?! Even Ross?
phoebe,Especially Ross!
joey,"(entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come back later. (He goes to leave but runs into Ross who’s entering.)"
ross,"Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)"

chandler,(not knowing what he’s saying yes to) Yes.
phoebe,"Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!"
monica,"Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side."
rachel,Ok. (Starts swinging Emma rapidly and she stops crying)
monica,It worked!
rachel,"Oh (happy) oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. (Emma starts crying again.) Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won’t stop crying."
monica,"Umm, she Rach, not it, she."
rachel,"Yeah, I’m not so sure."
monica,"Oh my god, I am losing my mind."

rachel,Awww. That’s so cute! Ross and Mike’s first date! [Beat] Is that going to be awkward? What are you guys gonna talk about?
ross,"Well, but, you know, we have a lot in common, you know, erm…he plays the piano, I played keyboards in college, or, he’s been divorced, I have…some…experience in that area"
rachel,Yeah?
phoebe,Hi!
phoebe,"Ooh. You’re first night out, indeed!"
rachel,"Okay, So now I think Emma is properly down for the night but if you need anything Ross…[pointing finger into his chest]"
ross,"Rach, Rach, Rach: we’ll be fine. You go have fun."
rachel,Okay. You too. And I hope you score.
rachel,Bye [to Mike]
ross,"So, welcome!"
joey,"Listen, I...i...i... need a good lie."
phoebe,Oh...ok..How about the whole man walking on the moon thing? Y'know? You can.. you can see the strings people!
joey,No..nonono...I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at the work thing today.
phoebe,"Oo. Honey, you stink at lying."
joey,Wha? I do not!
phoebe,"Oh really? Let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffeehouse, I went to the bathroom, and when I came back, my muffin was gone. Who took it?"
joey,"Somebody opened the door...to the coffeehouse, and a, Raccoon (emphasizes), came running in and went straight for your muffin I said ""Hey! Don't eat that! That's Phoebe's!"" and he said...[pauses for a while...realizing how stupid it sounds] He said ""Joey, you stink at lying"". What am I going to do?"
phoebe,"Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it."
joey,Oh that'd be great. That'd be great. Thank you.
phoebe,Sure. What was the work thing?
phoebe,Pick up grandma at the airport?
joey,Ohhh man! [Covers his eyes and bends down]
rachel,Oh she's precious...
monica,You don't need a shower.
chandler,"(still backs away) Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself"
monica,What do I smell? (sniffs him) I smell smoke. Huh--did you
chandler,"Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay,"
monica,(gets a pack out of his jacket)
chandler,"But, those are for you."
ross,"Alright, we'll just, uh, see when you get here. Bye. (hangs up)"
rachel,"Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave"
ross,"Oh, what were the other two?"
rachel,"Well, let's see. The first one is: I don't want to. And, you"
ross,"I know, it's the first time, we're leaving the baby and ..."
rachel,She is?
ross,Ya.
rachel,What about (?) Monica.
ross,"Hey, you only heard Monica's side of that. That little fatso"
rachel,Ish. I just don't think I can bear it.
ross,"Rachel, I know that you can. And you should."
monica,"Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?"
chandler,"Uhh, uh..."
ross,"(in a low voice) Answer faster, answer faster!"
chandler,I don't know!
ross,"(in the same low voice) Answer better, answer better!"
chandler,"I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a"
monica,What does she do there?
chandler,"Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me."
monica,She did WHAT?
chandler,BE-LOW me!
joey,"Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?"

chandler,Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
joey,I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
chandler,And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
joey,Yeah..I know.
chandler,What? What do you mean you know?
joey,ER....I just figured it out! You know..I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
chandler,Oh! Right.
chandler,"Anyway, er... I need to borrow some money."
joey,Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
chandler,Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! (Joey begins writing a cheque)
joey,Er....Well I...Know how much you used to make...And i know how much your rent is. (shrugs)
rachel,"Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me."
ross,"What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even..."
rachel,"Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out."
ross,What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
rachel,"I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?"
ross,Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
rachel,"Come on, I don't know what else to do."
ross,"Fine, fine. (To Emma) We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will. (Gives her a kiss, and the pink bow tapes itself to his head.)"
rachel,Ross?
ross,Huh?
rachel,You're pretty.
chandler,"Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be"
ross,So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
chandler,Yeah.
ross,(Hugs Chandler) Good-bye.
rachel,Why?
rachel,"Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin"
rachel,"I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick"
rachel,Oh no no no
rachel,So did I
rachel,It's just a cold
rachel,What? What's the matter?
rachel,Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.
rachel,"Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really."
rachel,I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
rachel,Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.

joey,"It can’t be me, I’m standing right here."
ross,No!
ross,Y’know what? I don’t like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on. (Walks away.)
joey,(To Ross) We’re not peeking? (Follows him.)

chandler,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Joey can’t know that I am here."
rachel,"Amy...Yes I do, I really do. [Reaches out toward Ross and he grabs her hand]"
ross,Sure! We don't live there but...
rachel,"Yeah, no Ross has a PhD."
rachel,God! She is...unbelievable!
ross,I know! I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
rachel,"Yeah, oh sure Ross yeah! If I have a heart attack at a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush!"
rachel,What? What? What happened?
ross,Don't say that!
rachel,Oh Amy...don't cry. Erm. Ross? Could I talk to you in private?
ross,Sure you wanna go upstairs? Or...
rachel,"Erm look. I was thinking, if it's ok with Monica, I would like to invite Amy, to Thanksgiving."
ross,You know I think that's a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims being in the Indian's syphillis.
rachel,"Look, I know she's a little tough to take...but she has no where else to go. And she's my sister. Alright? And she's Emma's aunt? And I'd like them to bond..."
ross,Ok...fine. But I don't want them bonding too much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
rachel,"Well! Ross, you know what? She may need one we're just going to have to make our peace with that."
rachel,Hi!!
rachel,"Hey you guys! This is my sister Amy...This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon!"
joey,Yeah!
monica,Hi. [They exchange pecks on the cheek]
joey,Phoebs! I still need some help here.
rachel,Uch.
ross,"Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you,"
rachel,Oh-A.
ross,"No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the"
rachel,You need to learn some new slang.
ross,"I'm serious. C'mon, you should go. Here. (shoves her outside,"
rachel,What ... Oh! (points inside)
ross,"No! No, you know what? (closes the door) You [can't get in"
rachel,I was just going to say that I left my keys.
ross,"Oh, (door is locked) holy moly are we in a pickle now."
phoebe,Where is everyone? They're forty minutes late.
joey,"I know, u-uch."
phoebe,"I'm starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate"
joey,"What about me, he? Only had one lunch today."
phoebe,"Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their"

chandler,I'm serious!

chandler,"(hanging up the phone) The wife says ""Hi!""."
chandler,"Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just"
chandler,"This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but..."
chandler,"Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! (He takes a step back, but she still"
chandler,I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ...
chandler,"(flattered) No,... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several"
chandler,I'm *happily* married.
chandler,"Right. So, I'm sorry..."
chandler,"Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know."

joey,Oh no no no no no...It wasn't...It wasn't because of your money problems...It was for something...for her.
chandler,What?
joey,Something personal.
chandler,What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
joey,Boob job.
monica,I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
joey,Well it's...It's not THAT crazy. ok? Making them smaller. That would be crazy.
phoebe,Oh! Alright. Well i think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomie.
phoebe,Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.
phoebe,What do you mean?
phoebe,Oh. Wow.
phoebe,Was it really that bad?
phoebe,Ok..well that's bad...But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.
monica,"(Enters) Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. (Sees Ross) Didn't see you there Geller."
chandler,"Yeah, Ross is here so..."
ross,"Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?"
monica,We're gonna have sex.
ross,I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
monica,Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.
ross,Pants off Bing!
rachel,"Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?"
rachel,"Hey, they were popular when I left!"
rachel,"Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?"
rachel,"Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just"
rachel,(Sits down in her chair) Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?
rachel,"Fine, I will. (Pushes that button thing on the chair that makes it ""collapse"") Alright, fill me in!"
ross,Hey.
chandler,Hey.
ross,You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
chandler,"Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits."
monica,"(Enters from the bedroom) Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees."
rachel,No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.
rachel,OK.
rachel,I thought it was Ross.
rachel,There isn't. There is totally isn't.
rachel,"All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in"
rachel,Yes
rachel,People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin
rachel,So seriously...rodeo clown?
phoebe,"""No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!"" Thank you!"
phoebe,Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.

rachel,"Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth."
joey,Dear Lord.
rachel,"I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?"
joey,"Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…"
rachel,"Oh look, she’s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesn’t she look scared?"
joey,"Y’know, I don’t really know her."
joey,(To God) Are you kidding me?!
rachel,It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!
joey,I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy! (Storms out.)
phoebe,Oh hey! Wait up!
ross,Hi!
phoebe,Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey ‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet.

ross,Ah actually we don’t. (Ross walks off)
joey,"Fine, fine okay. But I gotta say technically, I didn’t even do anything wrong."
ross,(turns back) What! (Angrily) You didn’t do anything wrong?!
joey,I said I didn’t technically.
ross,"Okay let’s put aside that you (Makes quote marks with his fingers.) ""accidentally"" picked up my grandmothers ring and you (Does it again) ""accidentally"" proposed to Rachel."

joey,"You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me."
ross,I’m not gonna hit you.
joey,"Why not? You’ll feel better! I’ll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes."

monica,Why not?
chandler,"Because I didn’t know how to tell him that I couldn’t go to the Knicks game, so I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa."
monica,So you lied to him?
chandler,"Eh, it is always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion. [Monica glares at him] Except with you!"
joey,Hey! Open the door! What’s going on?
monica,Hi!
joey,Why are you dressed like that?
monica,"[Nervous giggle] Because I, erm, well, Chandler’s gonna be home in a couple of days, so I thought that I would just, er, practice the art of seduction."
joey,I thought I heard a man’s voice before?
monica,"I was just doing Chandler’s side of the conversation, y’know like “Hi”, “How do I look” [In Chandler’s voice] “Really sexy”, “Could I be any more turned on?”"
joey,"Woah, woah, woah. Why are there two glasses of wine out?"
monica,"Because, one of them is for you! [Monica goes to get a glass. Chandler looks at Joey through the peep-hole and Chandler ducks. Monica comes back to the door with the two glasses of red wine. Gives one to Joey. ‘Clinks’ the glasses together] Okay, bye, bye!"
chandler,"You know, it’s funny. I’ve been practising the art of seduction as well! Hya! [Does a wiggle]"
monica,You might wanna keep practising.
chandler,Yeah. [Chandler’s phone goes off] It’s Joey.
monica,What?
chandler,"Hey, Joe!"
joey,"Dude, come home!"
chandler,What? Why?
joey,Come home!
phoebe,"Oh! Right ok. Erm...ok..So it's not just the lie you tell, but it's the way you tell it for example, if you look down on the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying."
joey,"Oh...(nodding)I don't know why this is so hard for me...y'know what I mean? Lying is basically just acting, and I am a terrific actor!(Smirks)"
phoebe,You are a (looks down suddenly) terrific actor!
rachel,Oh we just put her down for a nap.
ross,Thank you Amy!
ross,Emma.
phoebe,PHOE-BE!
rachel,"Honey, I don't know how to tell you this but, erm...but if something were to happen to Ross or myself...[Both of them knock on the wooden table]Erm...You wouldn't get the baby."
ross,"Well, we haven't officially asked them yet, but, we would want Monica and Chandler."
chandler,I can't believe you want us to raise Emma!
monica,"Yeah, Oh my god..I'm so moved."
rachel,"Amy, see, we're alot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them everyday, and truthfully, honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby."
chandler,"You know guys, I gotta say this, this means so much to me. That you'd trust me, with your child...I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own, and I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but...that you two....that you two..."
phoebe,One really does have a stick up one's ass. Doesn't one?
monica,How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad
chandler,"I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking."
monica,So what? Don't you have any will power?
chandler,Will power? I've watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs
monica,You said that was sexy!
chandler,"'kay, look: Can we just drop this? I'm not gonna smoke"
monica,"That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again."
chandler,You forbid me?
monica,Mhmm.
chandler,"You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she"
monica,"Don't joke (?) with me, okay? I'm very, very upset right now."
chandler,"Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?"
monica,Yes.
chandler,"Then, I might as well ... (graps the cigs) do this (lights"
monica,"Well, I'll tell you what we're gonna do: We are already late"

chandler,How drunk are you?
monica,Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that
chandler,(thinks) That's the perfect amount!
monica,Okay!

phoebe,No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No i just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in...and you start changing your mind..there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
phoebe,Yeah I get that.
rachel,Hi!
monica,So you gave in and decided to call someone?
rachel,Yeah...I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
rachel,Oh thank you so much. Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game.
chandler,Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
rachel,Don't look at me i never get his jokes.
monica,Thank you?
chandler,Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not...TWO...single things.
monica,Ok...you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
chandler,No no! I just love the way you look... I am warm...for your form.
monica,Ok..You know the old classics you know..You look nice? They're still ok.
ross,Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
monica,(To Ross) Sorry. (To Chandler) But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
chandler,"Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant."
monica,What are you talking about?
chandler,That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
monica,What!? You faked it?
ross,"You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual (He leaves.)"
phoebe,"Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?"
joey,"Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay."
phoebe,"Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans."
monica,What?
phoebe,"Yeah you're always singing ""Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy"""
monica,Yeah I do rock that one.
phoebe,OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
monica,Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...
monica,"""Delta Dawn"""
ross,"Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace"

ross,"Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose."
phoebe,Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
ross,(pause) I am a doctor! Y’know what? I’m just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
phoebe,"All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that she’s sleeping.) Should we wake her up?"
ross,"No! No, come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted."
phoebe,And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)
ross,What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she thinks we’re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we’re engaged?!
phoebe,Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
ross,I didn’t give her that ring!
phoebe,Really?
ross,No!
phoebe,So whose ring is it?
ross,It’s mine.
phoebe,Is it an engagement ring?
ross,Yes!
phoebe,But you didn’t give it to her?

They nod then put their ears back to the phone. Joey walks out of his apartment and up to Monica’s door] Right, look. If you can’t come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna…"
chandler,[Loudly] No!
joey,I just heard him!
chandler,[Quiet] Can you hear him now?
joey,"No. Right, I’m going in!"
chandler,[Loudly] No! Wait!
joey,I heard him again!
chandler,Right. Just stay there. I'm coming home.
joey,Great. I’ll see you when you get here. I’m gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.
chandler,Is that really necessary?
joey,"Absolutely. You’d do it for me! Not that you’d ever have to, ‘cos I know how to keep my women completely satisfied."
monica,"Ok...it's time for dinner! Erm...everyone, we're using our fancy china, and erm, it's very expensive...so pleaaase be careful."
ross,"Whoa.....whoa......[Laughs, then almost drops the plate but catches it. His expression turns serious.] Whoa!"
monica,"Ok er...just to be clear, comedy with the plates, will not be well-received. [Monica pinches Ross' arm. Ross flinches.]"
joey,Hey!! How come my plate is less fancy than everyone elses? Do you not trust me with the fancy plate?
monica,"No!!! Honey that's...that's a special plate! See, it's a game! Whoever gets that plate, wins!"
rachel,"Monica, is Ross' sister."
monica,That was me.
rachel,Amy!! You've GOT to stop doing that.
monica,"Ok...listen er...I know that you're having a little bit of a family crisis but you don't have to take it out on the plates! In fact I think, that, everyone, should erm...cut their food like this! (Proceeds to cut a turkey drumstick in mid-air over the plate) Now, see? This way you protect the plates, and let's face it. You have fun."
chandler,No...if crazy plate lady...[catches himself in mid-sentence] If Monica dies...then...I would get Emma...right?
rachel,"Well, actually...."

joey,"Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?"
monica,You're a really good kisser.
chandler,"Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you"
monica,Hm-hmm!
chandler,Okay!
monica,Wow! You are really fast!
chandler,It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
monica,We're gonna see each other naked.

monica,o..k...
chandler,I mean..You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
rachel,Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
monica,I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
rachel,I don't know! I mean...what brought that on?
monica,Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
rachel,No...you really think that's what it is?
monica,"YOu heard him! ""No bigger!"" ""You're perfect!"" ""Just don't get any bigger!"" OH my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler."
rachel,YEah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger..Your ass is gonna get bigger...You're gonna lose bladder control. (she starts sobbing) God! It's just such a magical time!
phoebe,Hi
ross,Hey!
phoebe,"Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage."
ross,Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean i can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
phoebe,No...i really wanted to know how you feel about it.
ross,Why?
joey,"Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress."
phoebe,"Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children."
joey,Nice.
phoebe,Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?
joey,"No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight."
phoebe,About what?
joey,He slept with you and then never called you.
phoebe,And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.
phoebe,"Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back."
joey,"Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!"
rachel,"Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me"
rachel,"Except that! (Mr. Zelner enters) Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon."
chandler,"I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed"
ross,This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
chandler,By drowning or...?!
chandler,Well...
ross,I know! (he stands)
monica,Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
phoebe,"Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone"
monica,"Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing ""Delta Dawn"""
phoebe,Can you totally see through her shirt ?
monica,"""To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"""

phoebe,"Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment."
ross,"Look, I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn’t want to either. But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?"
phoebe,"No! No, she said you actually proposed to her."
ross,Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose! (Pause) Unless uh… (Pause) Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I would do.
chandler,"Look, we can’t stay in here forever."
monica,"Oh, I still can’t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn’t make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!"
chandler,"This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)"
monica,Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?

ross,I don’t know. We can look it up.
phoebe,"Oh, god. Do you remember the girls’ nights that we used to have? Sitting around, talking about you and Ross?"
rachel,"Oh, god. It seems like forever ago."
phoebe,I know.
phoebe,So what’s going on with you and Ross?
rachel,"Well, um, I don’t know. I mean, for a long time, nothing. You know, actually, right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a little thing."
phoebe,Woah! Oh my god! I love things! What happened?
rachel,"Well, um, first he told me that he liked how I looked, and then, erm, we had a little, erm, eye contact."
phoebe,Eye contact?
rachel,Uh huh.
phoebe,I hope you were using protection.
phoebe,"Should we send them something back? Yes, let’s do! Let’s send them mashed potatoes!!"
rachel,"No, wait, don’t do that! It’s gonna make them think that they can come over here!"
phoebe,"So, what if they do?"
rachel,We’re not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend. I have a…baby and a Ross.
phoebe,"Yeah, but, um, nothing has to happen. Just having fun. You know, not everything has to go as far as ‘eye contact’."
monica,"Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you are not in Tulsa."
chandler,Don’t you think it’s better for him to think that you’re cheating on me than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? [Silence] I heard it!
monica,I don’t want him to think that I'm having an affair.
chandler,Alright. I’ve got a plan. I’ll go down the fire escape…
monica,Yes. Because all good plans start with “I’ll just go down the fire escape…”
chandler,"Hear me out, woman! I’ll go down the fire escape, then I’ll wait for a while. Then, when I come back up the stairs, it’ll just be like I got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in here and see that there is no guy in here."
monica,Aren’t you afraid that Joey’s going to figure all this out? [Silence] I heard it!
chandler,Actually what?
ross,Er...it's just that in THAT case...then erm...Emma would go to my parents.
chandler,What??!
joey,Er... Who has to die for me to get her?
chandler,"So, if Monica's not around, I'm not good enough to raise Emma?"
ross,"No, that's not what we are saying..."
joey,Yeah! He's lying he looked down! (Phoebe nods in agreement)
chandler,"What...what is wrong with me? Am I, am I incompetent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!"
rachel,"Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent! It's just that, you're more the...y'know, fun parent."
ross,"Yeah! And we wanna make sure that Emma also has someone like Monica, who's more of a disciplinarian...someone who can be firm, and strict."
monica,That's not how you see me is it?
phoebe,"No, you're all about the fun. (Phoebe is cutting her food like Monica told everyone to)"
chandler,"Look, I may not know alot about babies, but you really think I'm not capable?"
ross,"No...you both are equally capable. It's just that you're strongest, when you're together."
chandler,"Ok, so if we both had Emma, and I die [knocks fist on table] she'd have to give her up."
ross,Sure! Monica would have to give her up.
joey,"I lie better than that right? (Phoebe gives Joey a ""of course!"" look)"
chandler,"So...so let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma, then my wife dies, then Emma the one-tiny-ray-of-hope left in my life, gets taken away from me?"
chandler,You serious? (follows)
monica,Oh yeah!
chandler,"Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking."
monica,"Huh, and no cuddling."
chandler,And no kissing your neck.
monica,"Oh good, I hate it when you do that"
chandler,And lots of kissing your neck.
ross,"Okay, well the ??? is not home."
rachel,No. Uch.
ross,"Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has"
rachel,"Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to do"
ross,"I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y...you know,"
rachel,What if she jumped out the basinet?
ross,"Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped."
rachel,"Oh my god, I left the water running."
ross,"Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull"
rachel,"Ah, did I leave the stove on?"
ross,"You never cooked since 1996. (Actually Rachel cooked in ""609 -"
rachel,"Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird"

ross,"people (shakes head, they sit) so why you all dressed up."
phoebe,oh umm Mike's picking me up for a date.
ross,"oh yea now um how is that going, is it getting serious?"
phoebe,"oh I dunno I dunno, you know I mean I like him but am I ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market."
ross,"you know I really admire your whole dating attitude, it's so healthy I'm always like is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow? Where's this going?"

joey,She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
rachel,Bye!
ross,"Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you."
joey,"No, hey, it's been great."
ross,Yeah?
joey,"Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump..."
ross,"Yeah, that'll do it."
joey,"Wow! So, how are you?"
ross,"I'm, I'm okay."
joey,Really?
ross,"Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce."
joey,"Well, actually it..."
ross,"No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people."
joey,"Wow, really?"
ross,"Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me..."
joey,"Sure, I know lots of girls."
chandler,Two!
monica,Two!
chandler,Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively
monica,"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!"
chandler,Eh! (They start making out again)
chandler,"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
monica,"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not"
chandler,"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing"
monica,I think you're better than you think you are.
chandler,"Really? Okay, so..."
monica,(interrupting) Know when to stop.
chandler,"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
monica,"Yeah. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts"
chandler,Right!
monica,"I can't get married until I get something old, something new,"
chandler,"Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue"
monica,You're so efficient. I love you!
chandler,Let's go! (Starts to leave.)

phoebe,Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
ross,Never?
phoebe,Never.
ross,wow...are you still going to move in with him?
phoebe,"I want to...but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know...that i won't, i won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!"
ross,Yeah...marriage...stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
phoebe,That's not how you really feel is it?
ross,"No, I'm sorry. LOok i don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but i can't help it. I love marriage."
phoebe,Seriously? You divorc-o?
ross,"If you have to call me name, i prefer Ross the Divorcer. It's just cooler. Look...i know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Caroline and I had some good times before she became a lesbian! And once afterward. I'm sorry."
phoebe,It's ok that's how you feel.
ross,But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun...and you love Mike.
phoebe,I do love Mike.
rachel,"What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour."
rachel,"Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy"
rachel,"No, I can't, I have a baby."
rachel,Why would you do that?
rachel,That's really nice.
rachel,"Then you're not gonna like what's coming. (Starts crying) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you."
joey,Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.
joey,"Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?"
joey,"Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?"
phoebe,I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.
joey,You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
phoebe,"Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened."
joey,"Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped"
chandler,"I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!"
joey,"You may be a sissy but I'll still (pound you out on ground). All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one"
chandler,It’s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
joey,"All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so"
chandler,"Ok. First of all, this is green!"
joey,What the hell am I supposed to do!
chandler,"All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you."
joey,"What, what."
chandler,"Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine"
joey,Oh my God!
chandler,"Yeah, well, I guess you don’t need my help Victor Victoria!"
joey,"Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don’t know if I can take anymore"
chandler,"Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch."

monica,"Yeah, we’re trying to get pregnant."
monica,"Well, that’s okay dad, we-we can wait until later."
monica,Daddy?!
chandler,"That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head."
monica,Daddy! I don’t think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
monica,I don’t feel good right now.
chandler,"Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall."
monica,Hey.
rachel,Hey. I need to tell you something.
monica,"Well, now’s a good time. I’m on my way to have my ears cut off."

ross,What is the matter with you?!?
joey,You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn’t you duck?
ross,Why don’t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
joey,"Good, good yeah, (Grabs the bags) maybe while we’re there, they can check your reflexes. (Joey opens the door and it hits Ross in the face with it.) (Makes quote marks.) ""Oops."""
monica,Try feeding her again.
rachel,I already fed her.
monica,"I know, that’s why I said again!"
phoebe,"Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay? That’s just what she wants."
chandler,(enters) Hey.
monica,Hey.
chandler,Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
rachel,"Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I’m gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?"
phoebe,Oh I’m kinda part of this.
chandler,Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
phoebe,I knew I should have married Chandler.
monica,Okay what’s up
chandler,"Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?"
monica,Oh yeah (smiles).
chandler,"Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?"
monica,What? Who says that?
chandler,People who’ve never ever been to Paris.

rachel,Yeah! That’s my muppy!
phoebe,"Yeah, I’m sorry. We weren’t really looking for anything to happen with you guys. I-I have a boyfriend."
rachel,"Oh, it’s complicated. I don’t actually have a boyfriend, but, erm…"
rachel,"I’m sorry, no."
rachel,"Oh, sure!"
phoebe,Oh my god! You’re giving your real number!
rachel,Great. [Gives thumbs up]
phoebe,"Wow. So that's great. You, Bill, Ross and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?"
rachel,I don’t know. He was cute and he liked me. It was an impulse.
phoebe,But what about Ross? What about your moment? Don’t you want to talk to Ross about it?
rachel,"No, no, ‘cos I know exactly how the conversation is going to go. “Hey Ross”, “You know, I think that we had a moment before” [As Ross] “Yeah, um, me too” [As herself] “Well, but I’m not sure I really wanna do anything about it!” [As Ross] “Yeah, um, me, um, neither.” [As herself] “Ross, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we’re really feeling?” [As Ross] “Yeah, that works for me, um, um.”"
phoebe,"Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation. But your Rachel was not whiney enough."
rachel,Hey!
monica,Hey...there you are. You disappeared after dinner.
chandler,"Oh, did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?"
monica,Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about! I mean it's not like they're so responsible. Emma as a product of a bottle of Murlo and a five-year-old condom.
chandler,Y'know but they're right. I'm not a strong father-figure and I never will be.
monica,No....You learn these things. You grow into it.
chandler,"Yeah, but it's not who I am. Everything they said is exactly why I was worried about having a kid. And it's true! And, look, everybody knows it."
monica,I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad. At the fun parts and at the hard parts.
chandler,"Oh yeah, well, can you picture me saying, ""Go to your room! You're grounded!"""
monica,Can you hear me say you're grounded?
chandler,You said that to me last week.
monica,How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture!
joey,Argh. The producer from Days Of Our Life left me a message on the machine asking why I wasn't at the parade! They say everybody is very pissed off at me and they all got to meet Santa! [Whining]
phoebe,"It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and it doesn't invite alot of questions. You weren't at the parade, because you had a family emergency."
joey,Oh...I like that! Yeah! I wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.
phoebe,Ooo...What happened?
joey,Er...My sister's raccoon came.....
monica,Wha...wait what are you doing?
joey,Setting the table.
ross,"Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right. I think"
rachel,Ubb.
ross,"A pigeon, a pigeon. (previously scared Rachel turns away) No,"
rachel,"Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true."
joey,Maybe we should just eat now.
joey,"Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there's"
joey,But it happens? (waiter leaves) I'm gotta go to the bathroom.
phoebe,"No, you can't go. No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my"
joey,"If you ask me to stay, I'll pee. (leaves)"
phoebe,"Okay, fine, I'll move. Alright, you don't have to manhandle"
joey,(returns to their old table where elderly people are sitting
monica,Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby.
chandler,"Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we're"
monica,"Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted"
chandler,"That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not"
monica,"No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch."

ross,There isn't that's what I'm saying. (All happy)
phoebe,Oh my god you're right.
ross,I know and yet here you are all ready for the next date.
phoebe,"I can't believe I never realized this before, I'm in my thirty's and never been in a long-term relationship oh my god (starts crying) what's wrong with me."
ross,"no, no, no there's nothing wrong with you I mean you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway."
phoebe,I wanna get married (grabs a tissue)
ross,"please don't cry because of me pheebs I don't know what I'm talking about, I've been divorced three times."

joey,"I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody."
phoebe,"Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too."
joey,Why are they doing this?
phoebe,I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.
joey,"You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?"
phoebe,I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
joey,"I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed."
phoebe,I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.
joey,"Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name."
phoebe,"You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other."
chandler,"Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was"
monica,That'll work!
chandler,I don't think so.
monica,"Okay, now we just need something borrowed!"
chandler,(looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.)
monica,That's stealing!
chandler,"No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress."
monica,Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)
chandler,"Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)"
monica,"Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask"
chandler,Ehh.
monica,"Eh, you work for that."
chandler,"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should"
monica,You do?!
chandler,"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I"
monica,"Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what"
chandler,"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two"
monica,You thought about that?
chandler,Yeah.
monica,How many kids were we gonna have?
chandler,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."

chandler,Yeah?
monica,About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
chandler,But honey you don't have to.
monica,I'm going to get bigger!
chandler,Honey I...I love your breasts the way they are!
rachel,Argh. ***
monica,"Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too."
chandler,YOUR ASS?!?!?
joey,What?
phoebe,"Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!"
joey,"(To the director) Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy."
monica,You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!
chandler,Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
monica,"Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?"
chandler,"That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little"
monica,Like a month?
chandler,Or a year?
monica,"Really, you want to wait a year?"
chandler,"It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. ""Pants. Like shorts, but longer."" (Pause) It'll probably be more than a year."
monica,I really wanna have a baby.
chandler,"Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back."
monica,"No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration."
chandler,I quit and you learn what I do?
monica,"It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really"
monica,"""Take me to the mansion in the sky-y"". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?"
phoebe,Every little bit of you!
monica,"I can’t believe I did this. I can’t believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that"
phoebe,"Mon', not that you didn’t sound good, but..."
monica,Good? Didn’t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That’s is the best gift ever.
ross,"But, what’s great is that you don’t mind talking about it."
ross,Uh-ah!
ross,(pfew). Good choice Ross.
rachel,"Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I’ve been looking for you everywhere!"

rachel,"I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much."
monica,You can’t marry him!
rachel,Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
monica,Well do you love him?
rachel,Sure.
monica,Sure?
rachel,"Yeah, I mean whatever."
monica,"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?"
rachel,"No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?"
chandler,You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?
joey,"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out."
chandler,"Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look like?!"
joey,I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.
chandler,Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.

chandler,"The Sooner State, whatever that is."
monica,"Chandler, I don’t even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!"
chandler,Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
monica,"Are you trying to tell me that we’re moving to Oklahoma, or that you’re gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?"
chandler,"No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monica’s not impressed.) I’ll get out of it."
monica,Thank you.
chandler,(hears Emma crying) What is wrong with Emma?

rachel,"Dunno, do I have to decide right now?"
phoebe,You kinda just did. That guy’s gonna call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone. That’s a pretty clear message.
rachel,"Oh my god! Ross!! Ross is gonna pick up the phone! Ah, I have to get my number back! Oh my god! He’s gone!"
phoebe,"[As Rachel] “Ah, I have to get my number back!”, “Oh my god! He’s gone!” Dead on!"
ross,So soon?
ross,"Okay. Thanks, er, for the beer."
ross,"Ah, yeah, good times."
ross,Ohh. [Relieved that Mike has gone]
phoebe,I thought it might be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
monica,Oh..How nice! Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress
ross,"Hey dude, you ok? Sorry bout before."
chandler,"No, no that's ok. You're totally right I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But...you did hurt my feelings...so, I want you to know that if I die, you don't get Joey."
rachel,"Oh yeah...yeah, right. Remember in high school, when I died, and didn't give you my baby?"
rachel,You decorate dad's office and now you're a decorator? Ok! I went to the Zoo yesterday...now I'm a koala bear!
rachel,Suppor...You wanna talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby!
rachel,I did the FIRST time!
rachel,And...and you know what? You wanna know why I'm not giving Emily to you?
ross,Emma.
rachel,"OH! Whoose side are you on!/ I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way, you could handle the responsibility of a child."
chandler,"Yeah, let's celebrate life!"
monica,'kay.
rachel,"Och, god. (seeing Emma) Oh, thank god, you're okay. I'm so"
ross,Great. So let's get going?

ross,Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
chandler,Uhh. You are welcome.

joey,"Hey, this girl won't turn around and I can't tell whether she's hot or not, what do you think?"

joey,"Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom."
phoebe,"So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?"
joey,I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
phoebe,"Yeah. (BEAT) Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together."
joey,"Ooh, that's a great plan!"
phoebe,"Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my ""plan-laugh."" (A maniacal laugh follows.)"
joey,"Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh..."
rachel,Hey!
monica,Hey!
rachel,"You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?"
chandler,"See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries."
rachel,I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
monica,"Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?"
chandler,"(picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog in his throat) Hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog in his throat when he speaks again) Hello?"
monica,"(in her apartment, screaming) I LOVE MY NEW JOB!"
chandler,"Honey, you're screaming."
monica,YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
chandler,"(yawning) Oh, that's great."
monica,"Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean."
chandler,(clearly not so interested) Awesome.
monica,"(laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding."
chandler,Sure you do.
monica,"No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage."
chandler,You sure?
monica,Uh-hmm.
chandler,I love you so much.
monica,I love you. (They kiss.)
rachel,"(opens her present from Ross; it's a dark-red scarf) Oohh, I"
ross,Really? You're not gonna return it?
rachel,"Well, not (the|this) second!"
phoebe,"(at the window) Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!"
rachel,"Oh wow, it's so beautiful..."
ross,"Wow, it really is!"
monica,"""Wendy"" is a fat girl name."

monica,It's kind of a package deal!
chandler,God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
monica,I thought i was something that we both wanted!
chandler,"Alright look...if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?"
rachel,"Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?"
chandler,What?
rachel,Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
joey,Because she is!
monica,"Joey, Chandler knows i borrowed the money."
joey,Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
chandler,I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
monica,"It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I"
chandler,Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
monica,"Yes, please!"
chandler,"Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time."
monica,I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!
ross,"Oh, yeah, yeah that’s Michelle."
rachel,Who?
ross,"Oh, just this woman I’ve been seeing."
rachel,You’ve being seeing someone?
ross,"Yeah, didn’t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven’t being going out for too long, but rather there is this"

ross,Hey.
rachel,Hey.
ross,"Listen, I um… I heard about the engagement."
rachel,Surprised?
ross,"And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um…I didn’t propose to you."
rachel,I know.
ross,I don’t think you do.
rachel,You didn’t propose to me. Joey did.
ross,"Poor baby, you’re so tired. Rach, I didn’t propose to you, Joey didn’t propose to you, and Chandler didn’t propose to you."
rachel,"Uh… You didn’t propose to me, Chandler didn’t propose to me, but Joey did."
ross,Joey proposed to you?

chandler,"But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, here’s the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go there!"

phoebe,"Well, you have to go back in."
phoebe,"I’m so sorry, honey, but, okay. Rachel gave this guy her number, and, erm, she does not want Ross to answer the phone, so you have to intercept all of his calls."
phoebe,[To Rachel] He says that he can’t do that
rachel,"Oh, give me. [Rachel takes the phone of Phoebe] Hi, Mike! Hi, listen, I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what. If you do this, ah, Phoebe will do anything you want. Seriously, I’m talking dirty stuff."
phoebe,"Alright, give it here. [Phoebe takes the phone] Hello? I'm sorry about her, but, she wasn’t wrong about the dirty stuff."
phoebe,"Oh, oh, Mike! Bye. [Hangs up]"
ross,Hi!
ross,W-Why? [Blocking route of entry]
ross,"[Exasperated] But, you left!"
joey,"Ooooooooohoohooo.......[realizes it is the wrong time and looks away, at his shoes.]"
rachel,Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsibility? Your...Your inmaturity? Your total disregard for other people's feelings?
rachel,Timmy was my boyfriend! And you made out with him!!
rachel,Oh god! I cannot believe...i cannot believe that i invited you here today!
rachel,Hahah......Ahhahah...It's forty-five!
ross,Too far Amy. Too far.
rachel,You take that back.
rachel,Take it back!
rachel,Hey...man! I work out!
rachel,I do karates.
chandler,Leave it.
monica,I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said
chandler,You tricked me to get me into bed?
monica,"That's right, I got mine."
chandler,I feel so used.
phoebe,"Well, I guess they're not coming. You wanna just order?"
joey,"Thank you. (stands up and kisses her lips.) Waiter! 'lright,"
phoebe,Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?

joey,oh why don't you fly out there and surprise him.
monica,maybe I will go (thinks) yea will have a second honeymoon at the Tulsa romana.
joey,oh and you know what you should bring the black see-through teddy with the attached garters. (Nods)

monica,Oh my god.
chandler,Wow.
rachel,Why? What's the big deal?
monica,"Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are..."
rachel,"What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set."
chandler,"Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!"
monica,"You want a job? Turn off ""Oprah,"" and send out a resume!"
rachel,So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
monica,"Oh, it's perfect."
monica,"Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met. (Chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)"
phoebe,"I know! (Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want to let go of Mike's hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)"
phoebe,"Yeah, I kinda do. (Mike lets go of her hand) Well, how's this? (she takes Mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. After that, they hold hands again. Joey now enters, and sees the two sitting on the couch, holding hands.)"
joey,"(in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)"
phoebe,I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
phoebe,"(in a flash she answers) Maybe not, is it?"
phoebe,"(impatient) I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?"
phoebe,"Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars."
phoebe,"(really surprised) Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike."
monica,What are you doing here?
chandler,I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
joey,"Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?"
chandler,Monica.
joey,Got ya. (blinks an eye)
chandler,I never want to leave you again!
monica,"But I thought if you left, you get fired."
chandler,Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
monica,What?
ross,"What, you, you really quit your job?"

phoebe,Better..
ross,Hey Phoebs...You know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
phoebe,"Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah...No, thanks you."
ross,"Good, good. Yeah coz the more i thought about it, the more i realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you."
phoebe,What do you mean?
ross,"Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but...is that really you? i mean can you honestly picture yourself in a volvo?"
phoebe,THey are awfully boxy...
ross,I don't know...you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so...normal.
ross,I told you about my daughter.
chandler,And done!
joey,"Oh my God! I didn’t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around"
chandler,Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
joey,"Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!"
chandler,"Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about"
joey,Thank you so much.
chandler,No problem.
joey,"Listen that’s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it."
chandler,Yeah.
joey,Comb my eyelashes.
monica,"Ok, for my next song I think I’ll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer"

joey,"No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!"
rachel,"Yes, you did!"
joey,"No, I didn’t!"
rachel,"Yes, you did!"
joey,"No, I didn’t!"
rachel,"Yes, you did! And don’t you say, ""No, I didn’t!"""
joey,Ahhh!
rachel,He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
ross,Whoa! You were down on one knee?
joey,"Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn’t…I didn’t propose!"
ross,Then what did happen?
rachel,"Yeah, what did happen?"
joey,"Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing."

chandler,"No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (She glares at him.) That’s a picture of your daughter, isn’t it, well she’s lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I’ll call you from Tulsa. (Exits.)"
joey,"Hey, so how is it?"
ross,I broke my thumb.
joey,Your thumb? That’s weird. (Makes a fist.) You sure you’re punching right? Make a fist. (Ross just looks at him with his thumb in a cast.) Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
ross,"You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms. (Tries to hold the pen but can’t)"
joey,"You, you want me to help you with that?"
ross,"Why, does it look like I’m having trouble with my misshapen claw? (He hands Joey the form)"
joey,"Name? (Ross looks at him.) I know Ross but what’s it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher."
ross,Just Ross!

joey,"Wow, that didn’t take long. I thought you said Tulsa was a three-hour flight?"
chandler,"Well,… you’re forgetting about the time difference."
monica,"Huh, Chandler – you’re home!"
chandler,"That’s right. Your husband’s home, so now the sex can stop."
monica,What are you saying?
chandler,Joey said that you’re in here with another man!
monica,There's no man in here! How dare you accuse me of that? [Slaps Chandler]
joey,"Alright, alright. Then maybe you won’t mind if me and my friend takes a look around then. Huh! Where you at?"
chandler,What’s he doing?
monica,I arranged some pillows on the bed to make it look like a guy!
joey,"Bedroom’s clear, although you might need some new pillows."
chandler,"Alright, well, I’ll check the guest bedroom."
joey,Why do I smell men’s cologne?
monica,I think that's you.
joey,"Oh yeah, I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier."
chandler,"Nobody here, Joe."
joey,I guess not.
monica,I can’t believe you thought I was cheating. You owe me an apology.
joey,"You’re right, Monica. I’m so sorry."
rachel,Bring it on!
monica,Put the plates back in the boxes! Put the plates back in the boxes!
rachel,Did you just push me?
rachel,Alright that's it!
monica,Forget the bubble wrap! There isn't time!
rachel,Crazy crazy crazy crazy! [She says this while messing up Amy's hair]
phoebe,Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?
joey,What are you? Out of your mind? Let's toss some Jell-O on them!
rachel,Ew! Ew! Gross gross!
chandler,"Alright! That is it! This is our apartment and you cannot behave this way. Now if you can't act your age, then you shouldn't be here at all. Now, those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out...But they're very important to Monica...And I want you to apologize to her right now."
ross,I'm so sorry ...
rachel,"We got locked out of the apartment, we ..."
joey,That's a great story--can I eat it?
ross,And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
rachel,"N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got"
phoebe,And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
rachel,"Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I'm not distracted,"
ross,What?
rachel,"She spit up. Judy! She spi...Judy! Look alive, Judy! (they"

joey,"that would've been better, I'll try that Hi I'm Joey."
joey,look I don't usually ask out women that I meet in coffeehouses
joey,(turns round) gesundheit
joey,"really, great, did I actually ask you?"
joey,"(turns round again) seriously Gunther you should see someone about that cold, if it gets much worse you could DIE! (Gunther looks scared)"
ross,so how'd the date go?
phoebe,well it was awful every time I thought about what you said I started crying.
ross,So he hasn't called?

And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!"
phoebe,"Ooh, Joey."
joey,Hey.
phoebe,Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
joey,All right! Who is he?
phoebe,"Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me."
phoebe,"Oh, yeah."
joey,She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
phoebe,A teacher?
joey,"Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?"
phoebe,"Oh no, I want to."
phoebe,"Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)"
phoebe,It really is.
joey,"(sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with his own keys, Phoebe looks at him in a ""yeah, yeah, yeah"" way.)"
rachel,"So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her."
rachel,"That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?"
rachel,Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... (they're standing up and make their way to the door)
ross,Thank you.
rachel,Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
ross,"Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that."
rachel,What do you really want to do?
chandler,(realizing) I have *not* thought this through!
monica,Oh my god!
chandler,"I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it."
monica,"No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!"
chandler,Thanks!
phoebe,"Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could"
chandler,(flattered) Ahh...

phoebe,Uh huh.
ross,"Hey hey, can I help?"
chandler,"Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul...but these last three feet are where it gets REALLY tricky."
ross,"You know sometimes your words, they hurt."
joey,Hey eh..where do you guys want this?
rachel,"Yeah..seriously coz this is really heavy. (She suddenly lets go) I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys."
phoebe,Just one last time erm...the marriage thing...there's no wiggle room? None at all?
phoebe,Right. Except that i do want to get married.
phoebe,Someday.
chandler,Aaaaand.......hernia.
phoebe,I haven't exactly had a normal life and i never really felt i was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.
phoebe,"Because I just didn't know how much i wanted it. And i love you, and i wanted to live with you."
phoebe,"But i don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen."
phoebe,Are you gonna change yours?
phoebe,Me neither. I think i need to be with someone who wants what i want.
phoebe,Oh you’ll probably take care of that on your hands.
chandler,I am sorry I am late. You’ll understand when you’ll see Joey.
monica,"Honey, you’re just in time, I’m about to sing another song!"
chandler,Really? In front of all this people?
monica,And they love me!
chandler,Oh my God!
phoebe,"Yes, she gives the people what they want."
monica,"All right, watch!"
monica,"""Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in this"
chandler,Are those my wife’s nipples?
rachel,"Yeah, but you said, ""Will you marry me?"""
joey,"No, I didn’t!"
rachel,"Yes, you did!"
joey,"No, I didn’t!"
rachel,"Yes, you did—Oh my God you didn’t! (Screams) Well then why didn’t you tell me that before?!"
joey,"Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!"
ross,"Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!"
joey,(To Ross) I’ll tell you about it later. Be cool.

chandler,"I climb down the fire escape, and you can’t put that in the closet?"
ross,[Looking bored] Maybe you should look up fascinating.
ross,I don’t understand what just happened here.
joey,What’s going on?
chandler,I’m sorry. I told you that I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I didn’t…didn’t know…didn’t think you’d understand.
joey,"What? You think I’m too dumb to know that a husband needs to be with his wife? Uh? You think I’m like, duhhh! [Taps head with baseball bat – it hurts him]"
monica,Joey?
joey,Yeah?
monica,I don’t know what to say. We shouldn’t have lied to you.
chandler,"I feel so bad. Is there, is there anything I can do to make it up to you?"
joey,"You could go to the game with me, even though I know you said you couldn’t, but then you lied to me, tricked me and gave me a bump on the head."
chandler,I’m sorry. That’s the one thing I can’t do. I promised that I’d be with Monica.
joey,[Looking sad] Alright.
monica,You can go.
chandler,[Turning around] What?
monica,"You should go to the game. It’s okay, I want you to."
rachel,Mon...I'm so sorry.
chandler,"Ok...That's better. Now I want you to apologize to each other, and mean it."
ross,"Dude, well done! You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies, and Monica dies, you can totally take care of Emma."
chandler,"Oh yeah? Well, thanks!"
ross,"So, so, now do I get Joey?"
chandler,"Ok...but you should know, he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose."
rachel,Are you ok Mon?
monica,"Uh huh. These things happen. I mean it's just a plate, it's not like somebody died."
phoebe,It's alright...you can mourn.
ross,Thanks. Oh.
rachel,"Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave?"
joey,(mumbling) Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
ross,Y'know this ??? is incredible.
joey,Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
ross,"Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck."
rachel,"Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon."
joey,"And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because"

phoebe,"well you not what you should feel terrible about, this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?"
ross,We are a rare breed.
joey,yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that last piece of cake at the restaurant.
joey,do you have any cake?

phoebe,How do you even know a woman like that?
joey,What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
phoebe,Joey.
joey,I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
phoebe,So now what do we do?
joey,"Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else."
phoebe,"What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!"
rachel,Okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face while Ross crumples up the application form) Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
ross,"Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews (They sit down and Rachel sighs) And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with."
rachel,"(indignant) What, the blonde with no bra?"
ross,"She was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but then gets a ""gotcha"" expression on his face... There's knocking at the door.) Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years."
rachel,Okay... (Ross opens the door.)
ross,And she's a little mannish...
phoebe,(gasps) Oh my God! David!
phoebe,"(excited) No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?"
phoebe,"Who cares, it got you here."

joey,"AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright...(He takes a box out, about to close fridge, then thinks.) Better take all I can carry...Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!"
phoebe,"Oh? Isn’t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again."
chandler,I gotta stop this.
monica,"Oh, who cares, they still love me! ""I am so excited..."""
chandler,"You, touching yourself, out!"
rachel,Wow. She does that a lot!
rachel,"What, what, wait a minute! You haven’t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like"
ross,"I told you it wasn’t long, but there is an amazing connection between us."
ross,Are you kidding?
ross,We’ll see.
rachel,"Ok, Ross, what’s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?"
ross,"I don’t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?"
rachel,How do you know about that?
ross,"Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep..."
ross,"When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?"
joey,"It wasn’t my ring! It’s Ross’s ring! That’s why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose."
ross,What?!
rachel,You were gonna propose to me?
ross,Uhh… No.
joey,"Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}"
ross,"But I-I was going to see if y’know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that—I mean that-that was all, Rach."
joey,"Dude, step up! I proposed."
ross,"No, you didn’t!"
joey,Oh that’s right. There’s a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
rachel,Okay.
ross,(To Joey) I can’t believe you told her I was going to propose!
joey,I can’t believe you’re not going to propose!
ross,"Hey, I’m not going to rush into anything!"
joey,"Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!"
rachel,Oh my God!
ross,What?
rachel,"She’s doing it Look, she’s breast-feeding look!"
joey,"(looking at the ceiling) Ah, it’s beautiful."
rachel,Okay.
ross,Thank you. (The nurse exits.)
rachel,"Oh wow, this feels weird."
ross,Good weird?
rachel,Wonderful weird.
joey,"Y’know what you guys? I’m uh, I’m gonna go too. And uh, I’m sorry about everything."
rachel,"Honey don’t worry, it was my mistake."

ross,"yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please don't blow her off."
ross,well then I didn't need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagens I bothered.
ross,of course she has… if she'd never had a serious relationship I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
ross,"yes, yes I did… and I will also say what I'm about to say Vis-à-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her… super-serious relationship with… Vicrum."
ross,WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!

phoebe,No...
phoebe,I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
monica,Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
phoebe,He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
monica,"Oh, well... That had been your window."
phoebe,"Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible."

rachel,Score.
ross,"Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on"
rachel,"Oh God, I can’t believe you’re making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!"

monica,(walking by with Chandler.) Hey dad!
joey,Wow.
ross,"You know what, it’s, it’s better this way anyway. I mean I don’t know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It’s just much easier if we’re just friends who have a kid."
joey,Really?
ross,Yeah.
joey,And you’re Okay with that?
ross,"Yes. I mean, it’s what we always planned. And if you have a plan, you should stick to it. That’s why they call them plans. Hello? (Pause) I’m fine."

chandler,Nope.
chandler,"Hey! So, I'm gonna put the plates back. Y'know I think you're right...I don't think we should use these plates again for a long time."

monica,I'm gonna go freshen up ok
chandler,Ok honey… that was close.
rachel,Hello
monica,Hey Rach its me ok I just got the Chandler's room and I caught him molesting himself.
rachel,Oh that couldn't have been pretty… but you know guys do that.
monica,yea well the weird part is... he was getting off to a shark attack show!
rachel,Nooooooooo!
monica,Yes! Chandler Watches Shark Porn!
rachel,well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing?

monica,Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
chandler,It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
monica,Okay.
chandler,Tough crib.
monica,"Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here."
chandler,I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
monica,Chandler!
chandler,I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
ross,"Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?"
ross,"Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me."
ross,"Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone."

ross,No!
monica,Phoebe!
phoebe,"I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!"
monica,"Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?"
phoebe,"(sarcastically) Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am."
monica,What are you gonna do?
phoebe,"I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong..."
monica,You have to tell David!
phoebe,"Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey."
chandler,"(angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) Save it for inside! (he enters)"
monica,Heeeeeey!
chandler,Hey!
phoebe,Hey!
chandler,"So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch."
monica,(Doesn't believe what she's hearing) Was your cabin pressurised?

rachel,Why didn’t I get that message?
ross,What?
rachel,"From the guy in the bar, why didn’t I get that message?"
ross,Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
rachel,Ross?
ross,I never gave it to you.
rachel,Why?
ross,I don’t know.
rachel,Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?
ross,Who am I?
rachel,Yes.
ross,I am the guy who’s taking care of our baby while you’re out at bars meeting guys!
rachel,"Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you"
ross,None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That’s not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one
rachel,"Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What’s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they"
chandler,Hey.

phoebe,Shh! Nothing works with this child! (Hands her back.)
rachel,"Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can’t even comfort my own baby! I’m the worst mother ever!"

monica,"So, let's do this."
chandler,I - I don't think I can.
monica,"Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute."
chandler,Because of Emma.
monica,"Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone."
chandler,Sorry.
monica,"Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?"
phoebe,Okay. (and she walks away)
chandler,"What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? (Monica laughs) See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?"
monica,"No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?"
chandler,"Yeah, he came up..."
monica,"Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (Phoebe bursts out in a laugh)"
chandler,(to Phoebe) Were you there?
phoebe,"No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny..."
rachel,"Sandy, that's exactly what it is..."
ross,Are you gay? (Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed way)

ross,"Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?"
joey,Hey!
rachel,Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
joey,"Ha, oh, of course."
rachel,Thank you.
joey,Your eyebrows look weird.
chandler,"“Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped him"
rachel,Yeah I don’t think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.
monica,"Okay I’ll take her, here. (Takes Emma)"
rachel,I have to go to the bathroom. (Goes to the bathroom)
phoebe,I have to go scream into a pillow. (Goes to scream into a pillow)
monica,"(To Emma) Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby. (Emma stops crying and falls asleep)"
phoebe,(entering) Have I gone deaf?
monica,"It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!"
phoebe,You must be a fireball in bed.
monica,I can’t believe it! She’s asleep! I got her to go to sleep! I have actual magical powers!
phoebe,I can hear traffic and birds! I can hear the voices in my head again! (Monica looks at her strangely) I’m kidding. (She smiles wickedly.)
rachel,Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
monica,"Yes I did, I’m Monica, Super Aunt"
rachel,You are the official baby crier stopper!
monica,Yes I am!!
rachel,You’re never leaving the apartment!
monica,Say what?
rachel,What?
phoebe,"Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait."
rachel,"Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?"
ross,"You know, I think that's a good idea--our babysitter just"
monica,Bye.
joey,"See ya. Well, this is just us."
monica,"So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it"
chandler,"So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?"
joey,"Do, do you gonna do it now?"
monica,We don't have much time. Once the egg decended the oviduct ...
joey,"No-ohoh. (the Bings leave, the waiter comes)"
joey,"Nah, just me. All alone. (all the food is served) Dinner for"

joey,well that's not even the weird part… I don't think she remembered sleeping with me.
monica,But you don't remember sleeping with her.
joey,"yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am very memorable, you guys know."
rachel,"what, how do we know, we never slept with you."
joey,and who's fault is that.
monica,"what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night"
joey,HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN MOST!
monica,Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.
rachel,"yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other."
joey,Interesting… all right I'll go out with her again and try to get past it (reaches for the chips) OH SALT BLOATY!
monica,"Joey, Joey."
joey,What?
monica,you don't think sharks are sexy do you?
joey,No… (Pause) wait a minute what was the little mermaid?
phoebe,It's open.
ross,Hey!
phoebe,HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY! (She dances around with happiness)
ross,"YAY! (He continues the happiness with her by dancing around) quick thing, I went to talk to Mike."
phoebe,What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!
ross,"oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended up telling him that…"

monica,Canoodling?
chandler,"Well, I can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front of the B-A-B-Y."
monica,"I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so..."
chandler,Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
monica,I guess you're right.
chandler,"You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window."
monica,But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
rachel,"Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken."
rachel,"Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you."
rachel,What?
rachel,"Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive."
rachel,Ross!
rachel,Oh!
rachel,"Oh, that's pretty."
ross,(skeptic) So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
ross,"(on a yeah, right tone) Okay."
ross,"Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. (In the other room Emma starts to cry.)"
rachel,"Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed."
rachel,"Oh, that would be great! (Sandy leaves for Emma's room) I love him, I love him, I love him..."
ross,"Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!"
rachel,"So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out."
ross,"Because, it's weird!"
rachel,Why?
ross,What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...

rachel,Okay so listen I’m gonna go lay down.
monica,What?
rachel,You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be sleeping so… (She gives Monica thumbs and goes to lay down)
chandler,"(entering, loudly) Hey!"
monica,Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep
chandler,Oh so there can’t be any yelling.
monica,No.
chandler,We’re moving to Tulsa
monica,(loudly) What!?
chandler,"Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! (Walks backwards towards the door) I can’t, I can’t hear you. (He runs out)"
ross,Hey.
rachel,"Heeeeey, where have you been? (He shows her his thumb) What happened to you?"
ross,"Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him."
rachel,"Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit. (He sits) You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?"

ross,umm… that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.
phoebe,WHAT! WHY?
ross,well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
phoebe,(Walks towards Ross) If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW!
ross,"well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer (He makes a wow face) and he used to date Oprah. (He makes another wow face)"
phoebe,"I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him."
ross,Good yeah just be honest with him.
phoebe,"yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave… which he will and that's ok… so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be… it'll be fine… it'll be fine… I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh (takes a deep breath and sits down, knock on the door)"
ross,I'll get it

phoebe,"Hey, Rach!"
rachel,This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
phoebe,"You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends."
rachel,I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
phoebe,"Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned."
rachel,He's not stoned.
phoebe,Did he go out for a cigarette?
rachel,"Yeah, four times."
phoebe,"My dear, sweet Rach."
rachel,"(whispering and begging) Please? (Ross makes a ""whatever"" gesture) YES! Sandy you're hired."
rachel,Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
ross,You gotta be at least bi...
chandler,"Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks."
joey,Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
chandler,"(Can't believe what he hears) Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it."
joey,"I know, right? (Chandler has really big eyes, and nods) Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?"
chandler,Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
joey,Seriously? She actually said that?
chandler,Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
joey,Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
ross,Okay.
rachel,You know what I really really want?
ross,"What, Rach?"
rachel,"I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again."
ross,(smiles) Right.
rachel,"I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? Not easy."
ross,"Well, that’s what I’m here for. (Emma starts crying again) Want me to get that?"
rachel,No its really okay… Monica!

joey,my god woman! How many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this?
joey,"Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember me Hey! I still got it. (Turns back to Hayley) so were good. (She just glares at him) I'll let myself out."
phoebe,"…and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel."
phoebe,yeah well (pause) yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
phoebe,I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.

monica,She's asleep. Chandler?
monica,What are you doing?
chandler,Emma was doing it!
monica,She's asleep.
chandler,"Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can..."
monica,"Yes, but we have to be fast."
joey,Hello?
joey,Emma? Hey! Hi!
joey,"How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?"
chandler,Yeah!
joey,"Without that, you just got ""lame with women""."
chandler,"Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)"
monica,Hi! There you are.
joey,"(sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in size and he turns to Monica who doesn't understand what's happening. Then he turns back to Joey, who says ""you're welcome"" without a sound)"
phoebe,Oof...
phoebe,"Oh, wait, wait!"
phoebe,"No, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike."
phoebe,"Yeah, I should have told you."
phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
phoebe,I am happy.
phoebe,"Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do."
phoebe,"Of course, yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate..."
joey,"You know, ah, I’ve been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, it’s not my fault. It’s a natural instinct."
chandler,"(enters) Hey, what you guys talking about?"
joey,"Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this? (Swings to punch Chandler, he moves and he ends up punching Ross, knocking him off the stool. Ross then gets up and just stares at Joey.)"

phoebe,"well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so… (Pause) if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close my eye's make it less awkward (She sits with her eyes closed and Mike kisses her, Phoebe opens her eyes and like a little child says…) You kissed me."
phoebe,so you don't think I'm a total freak
phoebe,"I guess so, can I… can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and Phoebe pulls back) and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers."

ross,"Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight."
ross,Just the crab cakes.
ross,What's - what's going on?
ross,What? You - you're making money off my misery?
ross,"This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way."
monica,"Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast."
chandler,I think we may have really done it this time.
monica,"Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test."
chandler,You may wanna get some more of those too.
chandler,Where's Emma?
monica,"Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?"
phoebe,"I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the door and turns around again)"
phoebe,Yeah?
phoebe,"Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... (They kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... it's... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)"
rachel,(in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around and sees Ross) Hi...
ross,(very worried) Is everything allright?
rachel,"Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful."
rachel,I can't... I can't hear it again.
ross,"And I'm fine never having heard it... (Rachel looks at Ross in a ""why do you say that"" manner) Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?"
rachel,Yeah! (to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen with Ross and sighs)
ross,Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.

chandler,Okay. (Runs out.)
monica,"Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel."
rachel,"No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry."
rachel,Don't touch my coat!
rachel,"Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?"
rachel,"Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!"
monica,"Hey, did you stop by here?"
rachel,"Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all."
ross,"(picks up a cookie) Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)"
rachel,What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
ross,"(speaking with his mouth full) Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... (looks at the cookie) These are amazing!"
rachel,Sandy made Madeleines.
ross,"This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a careful bite from the cookie)"
rachel,"Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle."
ross,Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
rachel,"Okay, what? What is too sensitive? (There's music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved by this, but Ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the kitchen, angrily. The door he was holding, swings back and hits Rachel.)"
phoebe,"Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad."
phoebe,"No, no. No."
phoebe,"Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him..."
phoebe,(points to David) And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.

rachel,"What? What do you mean, ""there you are""? Where was she?"
monica,"Oh, we were playing ""peek-a-boo."" She just – she loves it when I'm dramatic."
joey,Because you two were having sex!
monica,"No, we weren't!"
joey,Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. (To Chandler.) You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
chandler,"All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating."
ross,Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
monica,Yeah! I think that's great!
ross,"Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?"
monica,Oh... How are they?
ross,(looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes back to serious) But that's not the point. (Joey now also enters)
joey,Hey!
ross,Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
joey,(looks surprised) Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...
ross,Thank you!
joey,That's like a woman wanting to be a...
ross,...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
monica,Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
joey,"Uhm... A penis model. (Monica can't believe what's she's hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?"
monica,"Yeah, so?"

chandler,"No, no, no."
monica,"No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!"
joey,"Hey, I gotta! Unless..."
monica,Unless what?
joey,Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
chandler,What? Why?
joey,"Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name."
chandler,Your family name is Tribbiani.
joey,(BEAT) (Laughs.) You almost had me.
rachel,"Well, uh..."
monica,"Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey..."
joey,"So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is... (he can't come up with anything)"
ross,Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
joey,...No... (he just can't seem to grasp it)
monica,I can't believe he's that upset about this...
joey,"Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)"
chandler,Hey!
joey,Heeeyy! Hey!
chandler,What are you guys talking about?

rachel,I just had a rough night.
ross,Oh. Crab cake?
rachel,Eww!
ross,"Well, what happened?"
rachel,"Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but..."
ross,Monica told me you had a blind date.
rachel,Yeah.
ross,"I did, too."
rachel,Oh.
chandler,"You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? (Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler seems happy again.)"
chandler,"You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)"
monica,"Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!"
chandler,"If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)"
monica,"Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! (Monica wipes away tears)"
chandler,What is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke)
monica,"Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! (Chandler turns to Joey)"
chandler,"Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)"
ross,
joey,
phoebe,
phoebe,
ross,But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
rachel,"Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?"
ross,Why does everyone keep saying that?
rachel,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up."
ross,That bad?
rachel,"Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this."
ross,Female body inspector? What size is that?
joey,Yeah....
chandler,So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and Ross walk away from the kitchen)
monica,"Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey."
chandler,Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
monica,"Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks..."
chandler,"I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside."
monica,"Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) That slayed me."
ross,"Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! (He points at Chandler. Joey gestures to Ross ""What are you doing?)"
joey,Not knowing when to shut up...
ross,Yep! That's my thing...
phoebe,"Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?"
joey,Uh-huh.
phoebe,How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
joey,"It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex."
phoebe,"Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes."
phoebe,"Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working."
phoebe,"Don't, don't do the plan-laugh."
ross,"The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters."
rachel,"Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show."
ross,"Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid."
joey,"We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding."
phoebe,"Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again."
phoebe,"Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!"
joey,Where?
phoebe,Mexico!
joey,Can you believe they're still not here?
ross,"I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?"
joey,"I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?"
joey,We've been stood up. (sniffles) And we want our free crab cakes.
phoebe,"No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend."
phoebe,"No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days."
phoebe,"No, no..."
phoebe,"Oh, well, yeah..."
phoebe,"Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! (they stop and Phoebe gets David's jacket and gives it to him) Here David, you should just go."
phoebe,"Okay, well... guys?"
phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand."
phoebe,Right! Never! Never! I swear! (They kiss... The door opens and David comes in again.)
joey,"Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns."
ross,Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
joey,Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... (he puts his fingers in position on the recorder)
ross,(looks angrily at Joey and points at him) I swear to God...! (Joey is in shock)
joey,Me! I'm up for puppets!
ross,"Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?"
joey,"I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. (and makes a ""there"" nod to Ross)"
ross,(shakes his head) Oh my God!
rachel,That was kind of rude!
ross,"Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me."
rachel,"You know, he was just doing his job..."
ross,"Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this."
rachel,"Oh, come on Ross..."
ross,"No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with..."
rachel,(sighs) Oh... That's true.
ross,Thank you!
rachel,"Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it. (Ross walks to the living room determined to fire Sandy)"
joey,(kind of emotional) I am learning so much from you.
chandler,"Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at http://www.hahanotsomuch.com/."
monica,"Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore."
chandler,"Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!"
monica,"Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you."
chandler,I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the back.)
joey,Allright. See you later!
chandler,See ya! (he leaves the apartment)
joey,(to Monica) Did that guy really make that joke?
monica,"Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out."
ross,Here goes...
rachel,I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. (Ross walks to the couch where Sandy sits)
ross,"Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out."
ross,"Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel..."
rachel,(from behind the bedroom door) YOU! You feel!
ross,I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
rachel,"(from bedroom) Oh, damn you Geller!"
ross,"Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings."
ross,"No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue."
ross,"You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you."
ross,Why... I... I don't know. (Sandy tilts his head again) Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
ross,"I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now."
rachel,(from the bedroom) Huh ha ha!
ross,"I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive."
ross,"It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... ""What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?"
ross,"I know I am! (Ross now starts to cry) ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?"
ross,Here come some more...
joey,Wow! You blow my mind...
joey,Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
joey,It's like the cheapest college ever.
monica,"Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...? (plays with her finger on Chandlers chest)"
joey,
monica,
chandler,"You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired."
monica,I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
chandler,You're on!
phoebe,Hey!
monica,What's up?
phoebe,"Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want..."

phoebe,Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
monica,I'm not sure about this.
phoebe,"Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business."
monica,No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!

joey,"Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie..."
rachel,"What? Ross and Charlie? (Joey nods) Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?"
monica,I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?

monica,"Bedsprings, unmistakable!"
chandler,You do realise that's your brother?
monica,"Not until you said it. Somebody switch! (Chandler makes a clicking sound with his fingers and Phoebe runs to the other wall. Monica returns to Chandlers wall.) Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with."
chandler,That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.

ross,"No, NO! (they're moving to the side of the bed, where they sit down) Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it."
ross,"Alright, I'm gonna go find them... (twitches a bit, looks down) I just need a... need a before I can... you know. (gestures standing up... they sit and wait for a while) Grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries to concentrate...) Okay, I see you later."

chandler,(caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!
ross,"Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?"
chandler,He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)
ross,"Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?"

rachel,"Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. (Joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) That's not nonchalant!"
joey,No idea what it means.
rachel,"Oh... okay, just hide!"
ross,(knocks) Rach?
rachel,"Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!"
rachel,There's no room under the bed. (looks around because she can't find Joey anymore)

joey,I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
phoebe,Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.

rachel,"(still searching) Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you."
ross,"Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?"
rachel,"(now looking up at the ceiling) That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say."
ross,"You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace."
rachel,You would think!
rachel,Joey!
joey,Is he gone?
rachel,(still can't find him) How are you doing this?
joey,Pssst...
rachel,How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
phoebe,"Now, what is this?"
rachel,"Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!"

joey,"(long pause and he twitches a bit) You're a pain in my ass, Geller!"
rachel,"All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it..."
chandler,"Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?"
rachel,Sure...
chandler,Enunciate!
rachel,Get out!
rachel,Are they right?
joey,"Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross."

rachel,No...
joey,I'm thinking about you...
rachel,Yeah...

chandler,What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
joey,"Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up."

rachel,Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
joey,I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.

ross,"I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?"

joey,I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
rachel,"Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him."
joey,"Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that."
phoebe,"Hi, Mike's place."
phoebe,"Ooh, that was fast."
phoebe,"Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I."
phoebe,Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
monica,
rachel,
monica,
rachel,

ross,

chandler,
monica,
chandler,
phoebe,"Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)"
phoebe,(stunned) I... I'm Phoebe.
phoebe,"Enchanté (she holds out her hand, and they shake hands)"
monica,"Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) Ow!"
chandler,"You go back to work tomorrow night, right?"
monica,Yeah!
chandler,"So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?"
monica,"Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. (she pushes Chandler on the couch and brushes her hair and shells against Chandler's chest) You like that, right? (again, she brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)"
chandler,What are you singing?
monica,"It's ""Bolero"" from ""10""."
chandler,"It's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from ""Apocalypse Now""... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!"
monica,You what? You said you liked them.
chandler,Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
monica,"Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does."
chandler,"Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different."
monica,"You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... (and she shakes her head more violently) OUCH!"
chandler,Hit yourself in the tooth?
monica,And the eye!
ross,"(gasps) Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. (kisses her) Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? (to Rachel)"
rachel,"That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams."
ross,"Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie."
rachel,"Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about."
ross,"(unpacking his bag) Okay, shoot!"
rachel,"Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal."
ross,(gasps) OH NO!
rachel,What? What is it?
ross,"Oh, major shampoo explosion!"
rachel,"Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy."
ross,"Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me? (looks up)"
rachel,Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
ross,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?"
rachel,"Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and..."
ross,"Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?"
rachel,"Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time."
ross,"Duh, you think? (enters the kitchen)"
phoebe,"Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off."
phoebe,"Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?"
phoebe,"Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours."
phoebe,"Well, I don't..."
phoebe,"Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you."
phoebe,"Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God."
phoebe,"Okay, not a fan of the tough love."
phoebe,"But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me..."
phoebe,"Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend."
phoebe,You're welcome!
chandler,"Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?"
monica,Not really.
monica,I have a problem.
chandler,Really? What happened?
monica,"Well, I was dancing around, and singing ""No W"
chandler,"So, you and Rachel tonight, uh?"
joey,Yeah. It's actually our first official date
chandler,Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
joey,"Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at."
chandler,What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
joey,(pause) It's OK!
chandler,How can you be so confident?
joey,"Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!"
chandler,Really? Like you have a routine?
joey,"No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness."
chandler,Really?
joey,"No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh."
chandler,You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way)
joey,"NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. (He starts lightly grazing Chandler's thigh)"
chandler,"Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. (They look at each other, both embarassed)"
joey,More foosball?
chandler,...and beer!!
monica,(entering) Hey!
monica,(to Chandler) Hey sweetie! (they kiss)
ross,(looking at Monica's legs) WOW!
chandler,Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
ross,"I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?"
chandler,She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
ross,"Eh, you got a spray-on tan?"
joey,"Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?"
rachel,We weren't doing anything!
joey,"Rach, he just saw us."
rachel,Shhh.
monica,Chandler gets pedicures!
ross,"(laughing) Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?"
chandler,(To Monica) Why...why?
ross,"Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!"
chandler,"Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off."
ross,"So, do you get colours or just French tips?"
monica,There. Here's their card.
ross,"Thanks. (he takes the card) Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he is saying) florist. (he goes away)"
phoebe,Hey!
chandler,Hey Pheebs!
joey,"But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss."
rachel,"No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados."
rachel,"Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill."
joey,"Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but.."
rachel,"We feel so terrible about this, Ross."
joey,"Yeah, but it did happen, so..."
joey,Ross?
rachel,Ross? (to Joey) Can we just close the door?
rachel,"Ross, say something. Anything."
ross,So you two are..?
ross,And have you .. ed?
joey,"No, no, no!"
rachel,"No, no, no!"
monica,Hey Phoebe!
phoebe,"Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town."
monica,"I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!"
chandler,Who's Amanda?
monica,"She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. (she apes Amanda using an awful British accent) ""Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"""
chandler,Are you trying to do a British accent?
monica,(pause) (to Phoebe) Chandler gets pedicures!
chandler,"Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?"
phoebe,"You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? (apes Amanda in a british accent) ""Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!"" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"""
monica,"I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met."
ross,"But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?"
joey,Probably.
joey,"No, no!"
rachel,"Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts."
ross,I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
rachel,"No, but you know what I mean."
ross,"Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. (Squeaky.) I'm fine!"
joey,Really?
ross,"Absolutely. (Very Squeaky.) I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, (deep voice) I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. (Screams.) But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this."
joey,Ross..
ross,"It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?"
rachel,Calm ourselves?
phoebe,"Oh, I know! ""Oh...I slept with Billy Joel"". All right, who hasn't?"
monica,"Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!"
phoebe,"Ugh, Let's just cut her out!"
monica,What?
phoebe,Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
monica,"Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! (to Chandler) Have you ever done that?"
chandler,"No, had it done to me though. Feels good !"
ross,"Well... I like how you look, what are you?"
ross,"Two, I think a two."
ross,"Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat."
ross,"Well, I have a PhD, so... (assistant walk out, not impressed by this statement)"
ross,"No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!"
joey,"Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?"
ross,"Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!! (Storms off.)"
joey,I do like fajitas.
monica,"God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives."
chandler,There's a hair in my coffee.
phoebe,Hey guys!
monica,Hey.
phoebe,"Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets."
chandler,"You know, it's funny. Every time you say ""triplets,"" I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds."
monica,That's sweet. Drink your hair.
phoebe,"Hey, what's all this stuff?"
ross,"One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis...(the sprayer starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room)"
ross,You sprayed my front twice!
ross,"No, I barely even got to three Mississippi."
ross,"Mississippilesly? (pause) Well, how bad is it?"
ross,"So, how dark is it gonna get?"
ross,I'm a four?
ross,(sarcastically) Really!
ross,(annoyed) Ok!
monica,"Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies."
phoebe,"Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!"
monica,That's not really how it works.
phoebe,"Oh, how does it work?"
monica,I don't know!
phoebe,"Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you."
monica,"Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?"
phoebe,Hey!
phoebe,Good to see you.
monica,Hi Frank.
monica,"Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!"
monica,Which one is which again?
joey,"Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date."
rachel,"Well, what would we be doing?"
joey,"I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home..."
ross,"Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns and the spraying begins, on his face) Ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) The same thing happened again!"
ross,(hysterically) I'm an eight!
rachel,Thanks for dinner.
joey,"I thought you paid. (Rachel does not answer and seems puzzled) Ha, guess we won’t be going back there!"
rachel,So.
joey,Yeah.
joey,"Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?"
rachel,"I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok."
joey,What’s the matter?
rachel,"I am sorry, I don’t know, I am sorry, I don’t know why I did that!"
rachel,"Ok, so sorry."
rachel,Feel me up?
joey,In a carriage!
joey,"Hey, Charlie!"
rachel,Hey.
rachel,"Oh, you bet."
joey,"So, did you bring a little something for Ross?"
joey,"Oh. Oh, thanks."
joey,"Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.."
ross,"I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! (Kisses her.) Hi Joey. (Hugs him.) And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. (Laughs.) I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. (He squeezes her hand.) Come, please come in. Come in."
rachel,"I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don’t know what happened, I must be nervous!"
joey,"I don’t get it, Chandler loved it!"
rachel,"Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great."
joey,Ok.
joey,"(a little giddy) Uh, was that good for you?"
monica,"(to Phoebe) No, no, don’t get it. Let the machine pick up."
phoebe,"Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again."
monica,It could be Amanda!
rachel,"Okay, well, we brought you some wine."
ross,Oh! That is so thoughtful. (To Joey.) She's a keeper. And what did you bring me? (Grabs the bag that Charlie brought for Joey.)
joey,"Uh, actually, that's.."
ross,"Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!"
ross,What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
joey,"Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink."
ross,You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
phoebe,"Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels."
phoebe,"Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute."
phoebe,"Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing.."
phoebe,"That's a, that's a long time."
phoebe,"Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area."
phoebe,What?
phoebe,"Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!"
phoebe,What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
monica,Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
phoebe,"Oh, you’re right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!"
monica,You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!
phoebe,"Ok, don’t hold thy breath!"
chandler,Hello? Is someone on the line?
chandler,"Hang on, she’s right here. (he enters the living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for ya."
monica,"We weren’t picking up, it’s Amanda!"
chandler,(to Amanda) I get pedicures!
monica,"Hi Amanda! Actually now... it’s... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? (Phoebe mouths 'no') Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!"
phoebe,"Why, why, why didn’t you just say no!"
monica,"Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldn’t say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!"
chandler,"So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?"
chandler,"I mean, you have a lovely home."
monica,"Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us."
monica,Oh my god!
monica,Thank you. (To Chandler.) I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
chandler,That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?
chandler,"You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?"
monica,It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
monica,Can I adopt you?
chandler,"Hey, you must be Owen."
chandler,"I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too."
chandler,"Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother."
phoebe,"(leaving) Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!"
monica,And you would?
phoebe,I did!
joey,"Rach, you sure you wanna do this?"
rachel,"Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some getting used to."
joey,"Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?"
rachel,"Ok, let’s work from the top down! (Joey nods, but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra, Joe!"
joey,"Ok, yeah, got it."
joey,This thing welded shut?!
rachel,Okay.
joey,"All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing."
rachel,Oh!
chandler,You know how to use a compass?
chandler,You do? That's fantastic!
chandler,"I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you."
chandler,What?
chandler,I got nothing.
ross,"The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood."
rachel,"Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some."
ross,"Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'."
joey,"Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?"
ross,"I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension."
rachel,No awareness.
rachel,Ow!
joey,Sorry!
rachel,Well this is romantic!
joey,"I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!"
rachel,It’s a standard issue bra clasp!
joey,Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
rachel,"Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?"
joey,(contemplates for a few moments what Rachel just said) NAH! I don't have another level!!
chandler,Hold on! There is something different.
ross,I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
chandler,Was that place... The Sun?
ross,"Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body, where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)"
ross,"We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?"
ross,My fajitas!!
rachel,"Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this."
ross,"Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!"
rachel,"Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!"
ross,That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
phoebe,"Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?"
phoebe,Insane.
phoebe,"Alice would never go for it, right?"
phoebe,"Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?"
chandler,Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
monica,"How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!"
ross,(looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five?
monica,One Two Three...
ross,"(Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel just enters, sees him and starts laughing)"
rachel,(laughing) oooh! Oh oh!
ross,(Still yelling) I Know!
rachel,oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
chandler,How was your date with Joey?
rachel,"Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!"
phoebe,Frank Jr.Jr.?
phoebe,Uh-huh.
phoebe,"Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?"
phoebe,"Alright, so that leaves Chandler."
phoebe,"Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids."
phoebe,"I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there."
phoebe,"Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together."
phoebe,Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.
chandler,Where are Bill and Colleen?
monica,They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
chandler,We have to leave!!
monica,Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
chandler,You didn't like that?
rachel,"Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!"
monica,"Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open."
rachel,"I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me."
monica,"Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that."
rachel,"(looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!"
joey,Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points to the hall).
rachel,"(To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment)."
monica,"(sees what he is doing) Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!"
chandler,(without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't know! (Monica just smiles)
monica,Hey Phoebe!
chandler,"I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him."
monica,"Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!"
chandler,But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
chandler,See? Intuitive!
chandler,Which technically now you should give back!
chandler,"I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. ""Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."""
ross,Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
rachel,Ooy.
ross,"And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?"
rachel,"Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?"
ross,"O is for ""oh, wow!"" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own."
phoebe,Hey!
monica,Is Amanda here yet?
phoebe,No.
monica,"(sits down) Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency."
phoebe,"Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?"
monica,"Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?"
phoebe,"(makes a face) Are you kidding, I love it!"
phoebe,Hi!
monica,Hi!
monica,(beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...
phoebe,Musty!
monica,When were we not friends?
joey,"Dude, are you okay?"
ross,Totally.
rachel,"Ross, you don't seem okay."
ross,No!
ross,Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
ross,Okay.
rachel,"Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me."
ross,"Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!"
rachel,"You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too."
ross,"Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone."
rachel,"No, no, it's just that it's getting late..."
ross,"Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good."
monica,"Ehm, we were friends in 1992."
monica,(To Phoebe) You were going to cut me out?
phoebe,Well...kinda.
monica,Oh My God!
phoebe,"Yeah well, in America you're just an ""ass""."
monica,"(Into the phone) Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more) Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)"
phoebe,(Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my God. Was Mike with him?
monica,Nope! (She turns and leaves)
joey,(To Rachel) Hey!
rachel,Hey! Got champagne?
joey,"Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!"
rachel,"Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove her bra from under her clothes)..."
joey,Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him)
rachel,"Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright! Lets do it!"
joey,"Ok, you're scaring me a little bit."
rachel,"Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like that huh?"
joey,Oh! yeah!
rachel,"You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively, putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)"
joey,uh uh!
rachel,"Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!"
joey,"No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!"
ross,I don't even know what that's for.
joey,You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
rachel,"Yeah, that's probably a good idea."
joey,Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
rachel,"Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this."
joey,"It doesn't look good, does it?"
joey,Morning. Here you go.
ross,Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
joey,Yeah.
ross,So you took off my pants and shoes?
joey,"No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen."
ross,What do you mean?
joey,"Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly.."
rachel,What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
joey,"(He just sits there, legs very close together with a painful look on his face) Soldier down!"
monica,We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
chandler,"If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!"
phoebe,"Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?"
monica,I have nothing to say to you.
phoebe,"Please, Monica? In the hall?"
chandler,"Well, aren't you a treat."
monica,"I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?"
phoebe,"It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill."
monica,I'm still all those things!
ross,"Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!"
joey,"It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel."
ross,"Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?"
joey,"That's what I hear, yeah."
ross,"This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?"
joey,"Come on, I mean, you know me, you know..."
ross,Joey.
joey,I'm crazy about her.
ross,And she feels the same way?
joey,I think so.
ross,"Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on."
joey,"Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it."
ross,"No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?"
joey,"No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?"
ross,"Yeah, I'm sure."
phoebe,You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
monica,(starts smiling) I am scrappy.
phoebe,"Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in."
monica,It's because I'm scrappy.
phoebe,"Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you."
monica,I won't know what I would do without you.
monica,"Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda."
phoebe,"Yeah, I guess you're right."
ross,"I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back."
ross,"Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?"
ross,Which... which... which... Which one is it?
joey,And we're okay?
monica,"Hey, Phoebs"
phoebe,Hey.
monica,"Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us."
chandler,"Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him."
monica,What?
phoebe,"Still, he had to find out sometime."
chandler,"Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?"
chandler,I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. (Runs off.)
ross,OH! SON OF A BITCH!
rachel,What is the matter with us?
joey,"Well, I know what's the matter with me."
rachel,"No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?"
joey,I don't know.
chandler,"That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!"
rachel,"Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?"
chandler,"Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys..."
rachel,"No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally..."
joey,"Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?"
chandler,"Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time."
chandler,"I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)"
rachel,"Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us."
joey,"Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit."
rachel,"Right, totally."
joey,"Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it."
rachel,"Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex."
joey,That's a... pla-an.
joey,(sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming.
rachel,I know.
joey,"I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted."
rachel,Hmmm... Me too...
rachel,I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
joey,I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
rachel,Aah... I bet you're right.
joey,So...
rachel,Yeah.
joey,I love ya.
rachel,"Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed."
joey,"Yeah, me too."
joey,"Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while."
chandler,"Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in."
ross,Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
chandler,"I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in."
ross,Really? Did you count Mississipily?
ross,"Dude, you're not tanned."
chandler,"No, I just had to get a picture of this."
chandler,I see you later!
